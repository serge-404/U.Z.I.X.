  BDOS system calls

So far, this list covers CP/M 1, 2 and 3, with partial MP/M and DOSPLUS
details. Some groupings I use are:

CP/M 1.3
    The 1975 version of CP/M available as source from the Unofficial
    CP/M Website. The version number of 1.3 isn't given in the source.
CP/M 2.2
    In addition to CP/M-80 version 2.2, this also includes CP/M-86 1.x,
    CP/M-68000 1.x and CP/M-Z8000 1.x.
MP/M II and above

      * MP/M II
      * CP/M 3 (CP/M Plus)
      * multiuser 16-bit systems such as DR-MDOS and REAL/32
      * single-user 16-bit systems *after* CP/M-86 1.1 and *before*
        DRDOS 3.41. This covers DOSPLUS and "Personal CP/M-86 v2.0/2".

CP/M 3 and above
    All the above systems except MP/M II
CP/Net redirector
    Any CP/Net client that allows access to drives on an MP/M server.

The system calls for REAL/32 (a descendent of Concurrent CP/M) used to
be online at http://development.imsltd.com/calls/allcalls.htm. This site
appears to be offline but some parts of its content can be retrieved by
entering the above URL into the archive.org <http://www.archive.org>
wayback machine.


    How to make a call

To make a BDOS call in an 8-bit CP/M, use:

    LD  DE,parameter
    LD  C,function
    CALL    5

and in a 16-bit CP/M, use:

    MOV DX,parameter
    MOV CL,function
    INT 0E0h

In CP/M 1.x, 8-bit values are returned in A and 16-bit values in BA. In
later 8-bit versions, they are also returned in L and HL respectively.

16-bit systems return 8-bit values in AL = BL and 16-bit in AX = BX.

The information in this list overlaps with the Interrupt List section on
INT E0h to some extent.


    DOSPLUS and DOS+

Note that DOS + is a CP/M extended BDOS. For information on "DOSPLUS
1.2" and "Personal CP/M-86 v2.0/2" see sections applicable to CP/M-86
v4; the underlying BDOS is version 4.1 in both cases.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


    The calls


      BDOS function 0 (P_TERMCPM) - System Reset


            Supported by: CP/M 1, 2, 3; MP/M; Concurrent CP/M.

/Entered with C=0. Does not return./

Quit the current program, return to command prompt. This call is hardly
ever used in 8-bit CP/M since the |RST 0| instruction does the same
thing and saves four bytes.


      BDOS function 0 (P_TERMCPM) - System Reset


            Supported by: Single-user CP/M-86.

/Entered with CL=0, DL=0 or 1. Does not return./

Quit the current program, return to command prompt. If DL is 0, the
memory used by the program is deallocated; if DL is 1, it remains resident.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      BDOS function 1 (C_READ) - Console input


            Supported by: All versions

/Entered with C=1. Returns A=L=character./

Wait for a character from the keyboard; then echo it to the screen and
return it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      BDOS function 2 (C_WRITE) - Console output


            Supported by: All versions

/Entered with C=2, E=ASCII character./

Send the character in E to the screen. Tabs are expanded to spaces.
Output can be paused with ^S and restarted with ^Q (or any key under
versions prior to CP/M 3). While the output is paused, the program can
be terminated with ^C.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      BDOS function 3 (A_READ) - Auxiliary (Reader) input


            Supported by: All CP/M versions except MP/M and Concurrent CP/M

/Entered with C=3. Returns A=L=ASCII character/

Note that this call can hang if the auxiliary input never sends data.


      BDOS function 3 - Raw console input


            Supported by: MP/M.

/Entered with C=3. Returns A=L=ASCII character/

Reads a character from the console without checking for ^S / ^Q.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      BDOS function 4 (A_WRITE) - Auxiliary (Punch) output


            Supported by: All versions except MP/M and Concurrent CP/M.

/Entered with C=4, E=ASCII character./

If the device is permanently not ready, this call can hang.


      BDOS function 4 - Raw console output


            Supported by: MP/M.

/Entered with C=4, E=ASCII character./

Outputs the character, without expanding tabs or checking for ^S / ^Q.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      BDOS function 5 (L_WRITE) - Printer output


            Supported by: All versions

/Entered with C=2, E=ASCII character./

If the printer is permanently offline or busy, this call can hang.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      BDOS function 6 - Detect memory size


            Supported by: CP/M 1.3 only

/Entered with C=6. Returns the base address of the CCP./


      BDOS function 6 (C_RAWIO) - Direct console I/O


            Supported by: CP/M 1.4 and later, with variations

/Entered with C=6, E=code. Returned values (in A) vary./

E=0FFh
    Return a character without echoing if one is waiting; zero if none
    is available. In MP/M 1, this works like E=0FDh below and waits for
    a character.
E=0FEh
    [CP/M3, NovaDOS, Z80DOS, DOS+] Return console input status. Zero if
    no character is waiting, nonzero otherwise.
E=0FDh
    [CP/M3, DOS+] Wait until a character is ready, return it without
    echoing.
E=0FCh
    [DOS+] One-character lookahead - return the next character waiting
    but leave it in the buffer.

Values of E not supported on a particular system will output the
character. *Under CP/M 2 and lower, direct console functions may
interact undesirably with non-direct ones, since certain buffers may be
bypassed. Do not mix them.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      BDOS function 7 - Get I/O byte


            Supported by: CP/M 2 and lookalikes. Not supported in MP/M.

/Entered with C=7. Returns I/O byte./

Here <iobyte.html>'s a description of how the IOBYTE works.


      BDOS function 7 (A_STATIN) - Auxiliary Input status


            Supported by: CP/M 3 and above. Not supported in MP/M.

/Entered with C=7. Returns A=0 or 0FFh./

0FFh is returned if the Auxiliary Input device has a character ready;
otherwise 0 is returned.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      BDOS function 8 - Set I/O byte


            Supported by: CP/M 2 and lookalikes. Not supported in MP/M.

/Entered with C=8, E=I/O byte./

Here <iobyte.html>'s a description of how the IOBYTE works.


      BDOS function 8 (A_STATOUT) - Auxiliary Output status


            Supported by: CP/M 3 and above. Not supported in MP/M.

/Entered with C=8. Returns A=0 or 0FFh./

0FFh is returned if the Auxiliary Output device is ready for characters;
otherwise 0 is returned.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      BDOS function 9 (C_WRITESTR) - Output string


            Supported by: All versions

/Entered with C=9, DE=address of string./

Display a string of ASCII characters, terminated with the $ character.
Thus the string may not contain $ characters - so, for example, the VT52
cursor positioning command |ESC Y y+32 x+32| will not be able to use row 4.

Under CP/M 3 and above, the terminating character can be changed using
BDOS function 110 <#110>.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      BDOS function 10 (C_READSTR) - Buffered console input


            Supported by: All versions, with variations

/Entered with C=0Ah, DE=address or zero./

This function reads characters from the keyboard into a memory buffer
until RETURN is pressed. The Delete key is handled correctly. In later
versions, more features can be used at this point; ZPM3 includes a full
line editor with recall of previous lines typed.

On entry, DE is the address of a buffer. If DE=0 (in CP/M-86 versions
DX=0FFFFh), the DMA address <#26> is used (CP/M 3 and later) and the
buffer already contains data:

DE=address:                 DE=0 / DX=0FFFFh:
buffer: DEFB    size        buffer: DEFB    size
        DEFB    ?                   DEFB    len
        DEFB    bytes               DEFB    bytes

The value at buffer+0 is the amount of bytes available in the buffer.
Once the limit has been reached, no more can be added, although the line
editor can still be used.

If DE=0 (in 16-bit versions, DX=0FFFFh) the next byte contains the
number of bytes already in the buffer; otherwise this is ignored. On
return from the function, it contains the number of bytes present in the
buffer.

The bytes typed then follow. There is no end marker.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      BDOS function 11 (C_STAT) - Console status


            Supported by: All versions

/Entered with C=0Bh. Returns A=L=status/

Returns A=0 if no characters are waiting, nonzero if a character is waiting.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      BDOS function 12 - Lift head


            Supported by: Version 1

/Entered with C=0Ch. Returns HL=0/

Has no effect except to return HL=0.


      BDOS function 12 (S_BDOSVER) - Return version number


            Supported by: Versions 2.0 and later

/Entered with C=0Ch. Returns B=H=system type, A=L=version number./

The system type is subdivided into a machine type and a CP/M type. The
machine type occupies the high nibble of the byte; the CP/M type is a
bitmapped field stored in the low nibble.

Machine types:   CP/M types:         Version numbers:
0 - 8080         Bit 0 set for MP/M        00h - Version 1 (see Lift Head above)
1 - 8086         Bit 1 set for CP/Net      20h - Version 2.0
2 - 68000/Z8000     (ie:network present)   21h - Version 2.1
                 Bit 2 set in 16-bit       22h - Version 2.2 
                    multi-user OSes        25h - Version 2.5 (DOS +)
                                           28h - Version 2.8 (Personal CP/M-80)
                 For plain CP/M,           30h - Version 3.0 (MP/M II, MP/M-86)
                 the CP/M type is 0.       31h - Version 3.1 (CP/M Plus)
                                           33h - Version 3.3 (Apricot PCP/M-86)
                                           41h - Version 4.1 (DOSPLUS 1)
                                           50h - Version 5.0 (DOSPLUS 2)

Sources differ on the value returned by DOSPLUS 2. Most sources follow
the Interrupt List and say 60h; my experiments on the real thing say 50h.

Confusingly, CP/M-86 v1.1 returns 0022h (ie, "8080 CP/M v2.2").

It is interesting to note that the version numbers returned by DRDOS and
Novell DOS follow this system; DRDOS 3, 5 and 6 are version 6.x, Novell
DOS 7 is version 7.2 and DR-OpenDOS is version 7.3. However these
systems rather unsportingly fail to provide an INT 0E0h call to get the
version number; you have to use INT 21h with AX=4452h.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      BDOS function 13 (DRV_ALLRESET) - Reset discs


            Supported by: All versions.

/Entered with C=0Dh. Returned values vary./

Resets disc drives. Logs out all discs and empties disc buffers. Sets
the currently selected drive to A:. Any drives set to Read-Only in
software become Read-Write; replacement BDOSses tend to leave them
Read-Only.

In versions 1 and 2, logs in drive A: and returns 0FFh if there is a
file present whose name begins with a $, otherwise 0. Replacement
BDOSses may modify this behaviour.

In multitasking versions, returns 0 if succeeded, or 0FFh if other
processes have files open on removable or read-only drives.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      BDOS function 14 (DRV_SET) - Select disc


            Supported by: All versions

/Entered with C=0Eh, E=drive number. Returns L=A=0 or 0FFh./

The drive number passed to this routine is 0 for A:, 1 for B: up to 15
for P:.

Sets the currently selected drive to the drive in A; logs in the disc.
Returns 0 if successful or 0FFh if error. Under MP/M II and later
versions, H can contain a physical error number.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      BDOS function 15 (F_OPEN) - Open file


            Supported by: All versions

/Entered with C=0Fh, DE=FCB address. Returns error codes in BA and HL./

This function opens a file to read or read/write. The FCB is a 36-byte
data structure, most of which is maintained by CP/M. Look here
<fcb.html> for details.

The FCB should have its DR, Fn and Tn fields filled in, and the four
fields EX, S1, S2 and RC set to zero. Under CP/M 3 and later, if CR is
set to 0FFh then on return CR will contain the last record byte count
<bytelen.html#lrbc>. Note that CR should normally be reset to zero if
sequential access is to be used.

Under MP/M II, the file is normally opened exclusively - no other
process can access it. Two bits in the FCB control the mode the file is
opened in:

  * F5' - set to 1 for "unlocked" mode - other programs can use the file.
  * F6' - set to 1 to open the file in read-only mode - other programs
    can use the file read-only. If both F6' and F5' are set, F6' wins.

If the file is opened in "unlocked" mode, the file's identifier (used
for record locking) will be returned at FCB+21h.

Under MP/M II and later versions, a password can be supplied to this
function by pointing the DMA address <#26> at the password.

On return from this function, A is 0FFh for error, or 0-3 for success.
Some versions (including CP/M 3) always return zero; others return 0-3
to indicate that an image of the directory entry is to be found at
(80h+20h*A).

If A=0FFh, CP/M 3 returns a hardware error <errors3.html> in H and B. It
also sets some bits in the FCB:

  * F7' is set if the file is read-only because writing is password
    protected and no password was supplied;
  * F8' is set if the file is read-only because it is a User 0 system
    file opened from another user area.


      BDOS function 15 - Open directory


            Supported by: CP/M-86 v4.

/Entered with C=0Fh, DE=FCB address. Returns error codes in BA and HL./

This function is called with bit 7 of the FCB <fcb.html> drive byte set,
to distinguish it from a normal Open File call.

Byte 0Ch (Extent) of the FCB holds a subfunction code, 0-3:

  * 0 - Change current directory
  * 1 - Assign floating drive N: to specified directory
  * 2 - Assign floating drive O: to specified directory
  * 3 - Assign floating drive P: to specified directory

Each floating drive maps to a directory on an existing drive. I refer to
the existing drive as the 'host' drive.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      BDOS function 16 (F_CLOSE) - Close file


            Supported by: All versions

/Entered with C=10h, DE=FCB address. Returns error codes in BA and HL./

This function closes a file, and writes any pending data. This function
should always be used when a file has been written to.

On return from this function, A is 0FFh for error, or 0-3 for success.
Some versions always return zero; others return 0-3 to indicate that an
image of the directory entry is to be found at (80h+20h*A).

Under CP/M 3, if F5' is set to 1 then the pending data are written and
the file is made consistent, but it remains open.

If A=0FFh, CP/M 3 returns a hardware error <errors3.html> in H and B.


      BDOS function 16 - Close directory


            Supported by: CP/M-86 v4.

/Entered with C=10h, DE=FCB address. Returns error codes in BA and HL./

This function is called with bit 7 of the FCB <fcb.html> drive byte set,
to distinguish it from a normal Close File call.

This sets the current directory on the specified drive to the root
directory.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      BDOS function 17 (F_SFIRST) - search for first


            Supported by: All versions

/Entered with C=11h, DE=address of FCB. Returns error codes in BA and HL./

Search for the first occurrence of the specified file; the filename
should be stored in the supplied FCB. The filename can include ? marks,
which match anything on disc. If the first byte of the FCB is ?, then
any directory entry (including disc labels, date stamps etc.) will
match. The EX byte is also checked; normally it should be set to zero,
but if it is set to ? then all suitable extents are matched.

Returns A=0FFh if error (CP/M 3 returns a hardware error <errors3.html>
in H and B), or A=0-3 if successful. The value returned can be used to
calculate the address of a memory image of the directory entry; it is to
be found at DMA <#26>+A*32.

Under CP/M-86 v4, if the first byte of the FCB is '?' or bit 7 of the
byte is set, subdirectories as well as files will be returned by this
search.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      BDOS function 18 (F_SNEXT) - search for next


            Supported by: All versions

/Entered with C=12h, (DE=address of FCB)?. Returns error codes in BA and
HL./

This function should only be executed immediately after function 17 or
another invocation of function 18. No other disc access functions should
have been used.

Function 18 behaves exactly as number 17, but finds the next occurrence
of the specified file after the one returned last time. The FCB
parameter is not documented, but Jim Lopushinsky states in LD301.DOC:

    In none of the official Programmer's Guides for any version of CP/M
    does it say that an FCB is required for Search Next (function 18).
    However, if the FCB passed to Search First contains an unambiguous
    file reference (i.e. no question marks), then the Search Next
    function requires an FCB passed in reg DE (for CP/M-80) or DX (for
    CP/M-86).

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      BDOS function 19 (F_DELETE) - delete file


            Supported by: All versions

/Entered with C=13h, DE=address of FCB. Returns error codes in BA and HL./

Deletes all directory entries matching the specified filename. The name
can contain ? marks. Returns A=0FFh if error, otherwise 0-3 (CP/M 3
returns a hardware error <errors3.html> in H and B).

Under CP/M 3, if bit F5' is set to 1, the file remains but any password
protection is removed. If the file has any password protection at all,
the DMA address <#26> must be pointing at the password when this
function is called.


      BDOS function 19 - remove directory


            Supported by: CP/M-86 v4.

/Entered with C=13h, DE=address of FCB. Returns error codes in BA and HL./

This function is called with bit 7 of the FCB <fcb.html> drive byte set,
to distinguish it from a normal Delete File call.

If the specified subdirectory exists and is empty, removes it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      BDOS function 20 (F_READ) - read next record

/Entered with C=14h, DE=address of FCB. Returns error codes in BA and HL./


            Supported by: All versions

Load a record (normally 128 bytes, but under CP/M 3 this can be a
multiple of 128 bytes) at the previously specified DMA address <#26>.
Values returned in A are:

0
    OK,
1
    end of file,
9
    invalid FCB,
10
    (CP/M) media changed; (MP/M) FCB checksum error,
11
    (MP/M) unlocked file verification error,
0FFh
    hardware error.

If on return A is not 0FFh, H contains the number of 128-byte records
read before the error (MP/M II and later).
------------------------------------------------------------------------


      BDOS function 21 (F_WRITE) - write next record


            Supported by: All versions

/Entered with C=15h, DE=address of FCB. Returns error codes in BA and HL./

Write a record (normally 128 bytes, but can be a multiple of 128 bytes)
to be found at previously specified DMA address <#26>. Values returned
in A are:

0
    OK,
1
    directory full,
2
    disc full,
8
    (MP/M) record locked by another process,
9
    invalid FCB,
10
    (CP/M) media changed; (MP/M) FCB checksum error,
11
    (MP/M) unlocked file verification error,
0FFh
    hardware error.

If on return A is not 0FFh, H contains the number of 128-byte records
written before the error (CP/M 3 only).
------------------------------------------------------------------------


      BDOS function 22 (F_MAKE) - create file


            Supported by: All versions

/Entered with C=16h, DE=address of FCB. Returns error codes in BA and HL./

Creates the file specified. Returns A=0FFh if the directory is full.

If the file exists already, then the default action is to return to the
command prompt, but CP/M 3 may return a hardware error <errors3.html>
instead.

Under MP/M II, set F5' to open the file in "unlocked" mode <#15>.

Under MP/M II and later versions, set F6' to create the file with a
password; the DMA address <#26> should point at a 9-byte buffer:

    DEFS    8   ;Password
    DEFB    1   ;Password mode <#103>


      BDOS function 22 - create directory


            Supported by: CP/M-86 v4.

/Entered with C=16h, DE=address of FCB. Returns error codes in BA and HL./

This function is called with bit 7 of the FCB <fcb.html> drive byte set,
to distinguish it from a normal Create File call.

Creates a new subdirectory in the current directory, with the given name.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      BDOS function 23 (F_RENAME) - Rename file


            Supported by: All versions

/Entered with C=17h, DE=address of FCB. Returns error codes in BA and HL./

Renames the file specified to the new name, stored at FCB+16. This
function cannot rename across drives so the "drive" bytes of both
filenames should be identical. Returns A=0-3 if successful; A=0FFh if
error. Under CP/M 3, if H is zero then the file could not be found; if
it is nonzero it contains a hardware error <errors3.html> number.

Under Concurrent CP/M, set F5' if an extended lock on the file should be
held through the rename. Otherwise the lock will be released.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      BDOS function 24 (DRV_LOGINVEC) - Return bitmap of logged-in drives


            Supported by: All versions

/Entered with C=18h. Returns bitmap in HL./

Bit 7 of H corresponds to P: while bit 0 of L corresponds to A:. A bit
is set if the corresponding drive is logged in.

In DOSPLUS v2.1, the three top bits (for the floating drives) will
mirror the status of the corresponding host drives). This does not
happen in earlier DOSPLUS / Personal CP/M-86 systems.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      BDOS function 25 (DRV_GET) - Return current drive


            Supported by: All versions

/Entered with C=19h. Returns drive in A./ Returns currently selected
drive. 0 => A:, 1 => B: etc.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      BDOS function 26 (F_DMAOFF) - Set DMA address


            Supported by: All versions

/Entered with C=1Ah, DE=address./

Set the Direct Memory Access address; a pointer to where CP/M should
read or write data. Initially used for the transfer of 128-byte records
between memory and disc, but over the years has gained many more functions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      BDOS function 27 (DRV_ALLOCVEC) - Return address of allocation map


            Supported by: All versions, but differs in banked versions.

/Entered with C=1Bh. Returns address in HL (16-bit versions use ES:BX)./

Return the address of the allocation bitmap (which blocks are used and
which are free) in HL. Under banked CP/M 3 and MP/M, this will be an
address in bank 0 (the system bank) and not easily accessible.

Under previous versions, the format of the bitmap is a sequence of
bytes, with bit 7 of the byte representing the lowest-numbered block on
disc, and counting starting at block 0 (the directory). A bit is set if
the corresponding block is in use.

Under CP/M 3, the allocation vector may be of this form (single-bit) or
allocate two bits to each block (double-bit). This information is stored
in the SCB <scb.html#f3>.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      BDOS function 28 (DRV_SETRO) - Software write-protect current disc


            Supported by: All versions, with differences

/Entered with C=1Ch./

Temporarily set current drive to be read-only; attempts to write to it
will fail. Under genuine CP/M systems, this continues until either call
13 (disc reset) <#13> or call 37 (selective disc reset) <#37> is called;
in practice, this means that whenever a program returns to the command
prompt, all drives are reset to read/write. Newer BDOS replacements only
reset the drive when function 37 <#37> is called.

Under multitasking CP/Ms, this can fail (returning A=0FFh) if another
process has a file open on the drive.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      BDOS function 29 (DRV_ROVEC) - Return bitmap of read-only drives


            Supported by: All versions

/Entered with C=1Dh. Returns bitmap in HL./

Bit 7 of H corresponds to P: while bit 0 of L corresponds to A:. A bit
is set if the corresponding drive is set to read-only in software.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      BDOS function 30 - set echo mode for function 1


            Supported by: CP/M 1.3 only

/Entered with C=1Eh, E=echo mode (0=no echo, else echo)./


      BDOS function 30 (F_ATTRIB) - set file attributes


            Supported by: All versions

/Entered with C=1Eh, DE=address of FCB. Returns error codes in BA and HL./

Set and reset the bits required. Standard CP/M versions allow the bits
F1', F2', F3', F4', T1' (read-only), T2' (system) and T3' (archive) to
be changed. Some alternative BDOSses allow F5', F6', F7' and F8' to be
set, but this is not to be encouraged since setting these bits can cause
CP/M 3 to behave differently.

Under Concurrent CP/M, if the F5' bit is not set and the file has an
extended file lock, the lock will be released when the attributes are
set. If F5' is set the lock stays.

Under CP/M 3, the Last Record Byte Count <#lrbc> is set by storing the
required value at FCB+32 (FCB+20h) and setting the F6' bit.

The code returned in A is 0-3 if the operation was successful, or 0FFh
if there was an error. Under CP/M 3, if A is 0FFh and H is nonzero, H
contains a hardware error <errors3.html>.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      BDOS function 31 (DRV_DPB) - get DPB address


            Supported by: CP/M 2 and later.

/Entered with C=1Fh. Returns address in HL./

Returns the address of the Disc Parameter Block for the current drive.
See the formats listing <formats.html> for details of the DPBs under
various CP/M versions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      BDOS function 32 (F_USERNUM) - get/set user number


            Supported by: CP/M 2 and later.

/Entered with C=20h, E=number. If E=0FFh, returns number in A./

Set current user number. E should be 0-15, or 255 to retrieve the
current user number into A. Some versions can use user areas 16-31, but
these should be avoided for compatibility reasons.

DOS+ returns the number set in A.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      BDOS function 33 (F_READRAND) - Random access read record


            Supported by: CP/M 2 and later.

/Entered with C=21h, DE=FCB address. Returns error codes in BA and HL./

Read the record specified in the random record count area of the FCB, at
the DMA address <#26>. The pointers in the FCB will be updated so that
the next record to read using the sequential I/O calls will be the
record just read. Error numbers returned are:

0
    OK
1
    Reading unwritten data
4
    Reading unwritten extent (a 16k portion of file does not exist)
6

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      BDOS function 34 (F_WRITERAND) - Random access write record


            Supported by: CP/M 2 and later.

/Entered with C=22h, DE=FCB address. Returns error codes in BA and HL./

Write the record specified in the random record count area of the FCB,
at the DMA address <#26>. The pointers in the FCB will be updated so
that the next record to write using the sequential I/O calls will be the
record just written. Error numbers returned are:

0
    OK
2
    Disc full
3
    Cannot close extent
5
    Directory full
6
    Record number out of range

11
    Unlocked file verification error (MP/M)
0FFh
    [MP/M II, CP/M 3] hardware error <errors3.html> in H.

If the record indicated is beyond the end of the file, the record will
be written and the file may contain a gap; attempting to read this gap
may give "reading unwritten data" errors, or nonsense.
------------------------------------------------------------------------


      BDOS function 35 (F_SIZE) - Compute file size


            Supported by: CP/M 2 and later.

/Entered with C=23h, DE=FCB address. Returns error codes in BA and HL./

Set the random record count bytes of the FCB to the number of 128-byte
records in the file. Returns A=0FFh if error (file not found, or CP/M 3
hardware error <errors3.html>); otherwise A=0.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      BDOS function 36 (F_RANDREC) - Update random access pointer


            Supported by: CP/M 2 and later.

/Entered with C=24h, DE=FCB address./

Set the random record count bytes of the FCB to the number of the last
record read/written by the sequential I/O calls.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      BDOS function 37 (DRV_RESET) - Selectively reset disc drives


            Supported by: CP/M 2 and later.

/Entered with C=25h, DE=bitmap of drives to reset. Returns A=0 if OK,
0FFh if error./

Bit 7 of D corresponds to P: while bit 0 of E corresponds to A:. A bit
is set if the corresponding drive should be reset. Resetting a drive
removes its software read-only status.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      BDOS function 38 (DRV_ACCESS) - Access drives


            Supported by: MP/M, Concurrent CP/M, CP/Net redirector.

/Entered with C=26h, DE=drive bitmap./

Locks one or more disc drives. Processes will not be able to reset these
drives; the effect is the same as if there were open files on the drives.

Returns A=0 if OK, and 0FFh if there is an error. If there is, H will
contain the error code <errors3.html>.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      BDOS function 39 (DRV_FREE) - Free drive


            Supported by: MP/M, Concurrent CP/M, CP/Net redirector.

Releases locks on disc drives.

/Entered with C=27h, DE = bitmap of drives to free/.

Open files on the drives in question must be closed before this call is
made, or data may be corrupted.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      BDOS function 40 (F_WRITEZF) - Write random with zero fill


            Supported by: CP/M 2.2 and later.

/Entered with C=28h, DE=FCB address. Returns error codes in BA and HL./

As function 34 <#34>, but if the write is to a newly allocated disc
block the remainder of the block is filled with zeroes.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      BDOS function 41 - Test and write record


            Supported by: MP/M, Concurrent CP/M.

/Entered with C=29h, DE=FCB address. Returns error codes in BA and HL./

This function compares the contents of the file with the record at the
DMA address <#26>. If the comparison is successful, the data at (DMA +
record size) are written to the file.

For example, if the multisector count <#44> is set to 4 records, the DMA
address will have 512 bytes (4x128) to compare with the file, and then
another 512 to write to the file. On return, A is:

0
    OK
1
    Reading unwritten data
3
    Cannot close current extent
4
    Seek to unwritten extent (a 16k portion of file does not exist)

            Supported by: MP/M, Concurrent CP/M, CP/Net redirector.

/Entered with C=2Ah, DE=FCB address. Returns error codes in BA and HL./

This function locks the number of records specified by function 44
<#44>, starting at the record number at FCB+21h. The DMA address should
point to the file ID returned by function 15 <#15>. On return, A is:

0
    OK
1
    Reading unwritten data
3
    Cannot close current extent
4
    Seek to unwritten extent (a 16k portion of file does not exist)

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      BDOS function 43 (F_UNLOCK) - Unlock record


            Supported by: MP/M, Concurrent CP/M, CP/Net redirector.

/Entered with C=2Bh, DE=FCB address. Returns error codes in BA and HL./

This function behaves as function 42 <#42> above, but unlocks records
rather than locking them. If a record is locked by a different process,
it remains locked; but no error is returned.

Set F5' to 1 to unlock all records rather than just the ones the FCB
refers to.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      BDOS function 44 (F_MULTISEC) - Set number of records to
      read/write at once


            Supported by: MP/M II and later.

/Entered with C=2Ch, E=number of records. Returns A=0 or 0FFh./

Sets the number of records that functions 14, 15, 31, 32 and 40 should
attempt to read at once. E should be 1-16 in MP/M II; 1-127 in CP/M 3
and later. Returns A=0 if E was valid, 0FFh otherwise. The random access
counters still operate with 128 bytes/record.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      BDOS function 45 (F_ERRMODE) - Set action on hardware error


            Supported by: Personal CP/M, MP/M II and later, CP/Net
            redirector.

/Entered with C=2Dh, E=action./

Instructs CP/M what action to take if there is a hardware error
<errors3.html>:

E < 254
    Compatibility mode; program is terminated and an error message printed.
E = 254
    Error code is returned in H, error message is printed.
E = 255
    Error code is returned in H, no error message is printed.

Note that the messages (if printed) are not followed by a carriage
return or linefeed.

If this function is being provided by CP/Net, then it only affects
network errors.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      BDOS function 46 (DRV_SPACE) - Find free space on a drive


            Supported by: MP/M II and later.

/Entered with C=2Eh, E=drive. Returns error codes in BA and HL./

Sets the three bytes at the DMA address <#26> to the number of free
128-byte records on the disc, low byte first. E is the drive (0 for A:,
1 for B: etc.). If on return A=0FFh, there is a hardware error
<errors3.html> in H.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      BDOS function 47 (P_CHAIN) - Chain to program


            Supported by: MP/M II and later; CP/M-86 v1.1

/Entered with C=2Fh, E=chain flag. Only returns if it fails./

Execute the command line at 80h. The error return code <#108> is not
changed, so the new program can discover the status returned by the
previous one.

If E=255, then the currently set drive and user (as set by calls 25
<#25> and 32 <#32>) become those used by the CCP; otherwise the CCP
drive and user remain the same.

In MP/M II, there is no chain flag; and this call will return if the
process is not attached to the screen.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      BDOS function 48 (DRV_FLUSH) - Empty disc buffers


            Supported by: Personal CP/M; MP/M II and later; CP/M-86 v1.1

/Entered with C=30h, E=flag. Returns error codes in BA and HL./

Forces all pending disc writes to be executed. If E=255, then all disc
read buffers are emptied as well (so that information must be read from
the disc - used by file verification programs).

Returns A=0FFh if there is a hardware error <errors3.html> in H.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      BDOS function 49 - Access the System Control Block


            Supported by: CP/M 3.

/Entered with C=31h, DE=address of parameter area. Returned values vary./

The SCB <scb.html> is a 100-byte area of memory (officially) used for
storing system settings. The parameter area is formed:

pb+0:   DB  offset      ;0-99
pb+1:   DB  command     ;0    => Read byte at /offset/ into A, 
                        ;        and word at /offset/ into HL.
                        ;0FEh => Write word at pb+2 to SCB at 
                        ;        /offset/ and /offset/+1
                        ;0FFh => Write byte at pb+2 to SCB at /offset/


      BDOS function 49 - Return address of system variables


            Supported by: CP/M-86 v1.1

      BDOS function 49 (S_SYSVAR) - Access the system variables


            Supported by: CP/M-86 v4.

/Entered with CL=31h, DX=address of parameter area. Returns AX=BX=0 if
variable is valid, 0FFFFh if invalid./

The BDOS 4.1 system variables contain various system settings. The
parameter area is formed:

pb+0:   DB  system variable     ;0-5
pb+1:   DB  command             ;0    => Read the specified variable into 
                                ;           buffer at pb+2.
                                ;0FFh => Write data at pb+2 to specified 
                                ;           variable.

Variables are:

Number  Length  Description
0   1   screen width-1

      BDOS function 50 (S_BIOS) - Use the BIOS


            Supported by: CP/M 3 and later; CP/M-86 v1.1

/Entered with C=32h, DE=address of parameter area. Returned values vary./

Under CP/M 3, the BIOS should not be directly called, except possibly
the character I/O and USERF <bios.html#userf> calls. Instead, this
function should be used. The parameter area is formed:

pb+0:   DB  bios-function   ;0-32

Under 16-bit versions, this function should be used for all BIOS calls;
only character I/O BIOS calls are permitted. The parameter area is formed:

pb+0:   DB  bios-function
pb+1:   DB  bios-cl
pb+2:   DB  bios-ch
pb+3:   DB  bios-dl
pb+4:   DB  bios-dh

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      BDOS function 54 (MC_ABSMAX) - Allocate absolute maximum memory


            Supported by: CP/M-86 v1.1 and later.

/Entered with CL=36h, DX=address of MCB <MCB.html>/

Set MCB_EXT to 2 if the memory should remain allocated after program
termination. Set MCB_LENGTH to maximum required length, and MCB_SEGMENT
to the required start paragraph.

Returns MCB_EXT=0 if no additional memory is available, 1 if there is.
Sets MCB_SEGMENT and MCB_LENGTH to the values for the memory block

Returns AX=0 if OK, 0FFFFh if error; CX=error code <#53d>.


      Z80DOS function 54 - Get file time stamps


            Supported by: Z80DOS, ZPM3

/Entered with C=36h. Returns HL=address of stamp/.

This returns the timestamp from the last file used by functions 15
<#15>, 17 <#17> or 18 <#18>. The format of a Z80DOS timestamp is:

    DW  creation date
    DW  modification date
    DB  modification time, hours,   BCD
    DB  modification time, minutes, BCD
    DW  last access date
    DB  last access time, hours, BCD
    DW  last access time, minutes, BCD

More information on Z80DOS and ZPM3 <dosses.html>.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      BDOS function 55 (MC_ALLOC) - Allocate memory


            Supported by: CP/M-86 v1.1 and later.

/Entered with CL=37h, DX=address of MCB <MCB.html>/

Set MCB_EXT to 2 if the memory should remain allocated after program
termination. Set MCB_LENGTH to maximum required length.

Returns MCB_EXT=0 if no additional memory is available, 1 if there is.
Sets MCB_SEGMENT and MCB_LENGTH to the values for the memory block
allocated, which will be exactly the size requested. Returns AX=0 if OK,
0FFFFh if error; CX=error code <#53d>.


      Z80DOS function 55 - Use file time stamps


            Supported by: Z80DOS, ZPM3

/Entered with C=37h/.

The next BDOS call will use the timestamp buffer <#54z> returned by
function 54 <#54z>, rather than the current time. This would normally
done before creating <#22> or closing <#16> the file.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      BDOS function 56 (MC_ABSALLOC) - Allocate absolute memory


            Supported by: CP/M-86 v1.1 and later.

/Entered with CL=38h, DX=address of MCB <MCB.html>/

Set MCB_EXT to 2 if the memory should remain allocated after program
termination. Set MCB_LENGTH to maximum required length, and MCB_SEGMENT
to the required start paragraph.

Returns MCB_EXT=0 if no additional memory is available, 1 if there is.
Sets MCB_SEGMENT and MCB_LENGTH to the values for the memory block
allocated, which will be exactly the size requested. Returns AX=0 if OK,
0FFFFh if error; CX=error code <#53d>.

In the 4.1 BDOS (and possibly earlier) it is possible to call this with
MCB_EXT set to 2 on a memory block that has already been allocated; this
will make the block remain after program termination if it didn't before.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      BDOS function 57 (MC_FREE) - Free memory


            Supported by: CP/M-86 v1.1 and later.

/Entered with CL=39h, DX=address of MCB <MCB.html>/

Set MCB_SEGMENT to start of area, MCB_LENGTH to length. It is not
possible to deallocate the middle or start of an area which was
allocated as one piece. Set MCB_EXT to 0 to free the specified MCB, or
0FFh to free all this program's memory. Returns AX=0 if OK, 0FFFFh if
error; CX=error code <#53d>.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      BDOS function 58 (MC_ALLFREE) - Free all memory


            Supported by: CP/M-86 v1.1 and later.

/Entered with CL=3Ah./ This function is obsolete in CP/M-86 v3.x+. In
CP/M-86 v1.1, it is called by the CCP to empty memory before a new
program is loaded. In Concurrent CP/M, it should not be called by user
programs.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      BDOS function 59 (P_LOAD) - Load overlay


            Supported by: CP/M 3 and higher Loaders.

/Entered with C=3Bh, DE=FCB address. Returns error code in A./

Load a program or RSX. The FCB should have been opened before making
this call; the load address should be stored at FCB+21h. If the program
is a PRL (Paged Relocatable), the original CP/M loader will relocate it;
some replacement loaders, such as that in CCP+ <files.html#ccp105p> need
a special flag set to indicate this.

If DE=0, the Loader will not load anything, but it will remove from the
RSX chain any RSXs marked as due for deletion.

Returns A=0 if OK, 0FEh if there was an error, or 0FFh if the Loader is
not present.

In CP/M-86 operating systems, this will load the CMD file at the DMA
address, and returns the segment of the Zero Page allocated to the
program in BX.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      BDOS function 60 - Call to RSX


            Supported by: CP/M 3 and later RSXs.

/Entered with C=3Ch, DE=RSXPB address/

This call is provided for programs to communicate with Resident System
Extensions. There is a separate list <rsxcalls.html> of functions
provided by specific RSXs. The format of the RSXPB is:

    DEFB    function, 0-127 ;(128-255 used internally by CP/M)
    DEFB    numwords    ;Number of parameter words passed to RSX.
    DEFW    parameters

A popular convention is for the first parameter word to point to a copy
within the program of the name of the intended RSX; for example:

RSXPB:  DEFB    100     ;Function
        DEFB    1       ;1 Parameter
        DEFW    RNAME   ;RSX name
RNAME:  DEFB    'GETERL  '

This call returns BA=HL=00FFh if the requested RSX is not resident;
otherwise, the values are those returned by the RSX.
------------------------------------------------------------------------


      BDOS function 61 - Rename file


            Supported by: DOS Plus v2.1

/Entered with C=3Dh, DE=address of FCB. Returns error codes in BA and HL./

This works the same way as the normal rename function <#23>, except that
it can rename a file across drives if the two drives are 'really' the
same (that is, one is a floating drive and the other is its host).

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      BDOS function 62 - Unknown


            Supported by: DOS Plus v2.1

This is a function that was internal to DOS Plus 1.2 and earlier. It
allocates a new current directory structure for the active process.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      BDOS function 64 - Log in


            Supported by: CP/Net.

/Enter with C=40h, DE=address of login record:/

    DB  network ID of server
    DS  8   ;Password

Network IDs are 0-254. The server is normally number 0.

Returns A=0 if successful or already logged in; 0FFh if failed. Logging
in can fail if the server does not exist, or the password was incorrect.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      BDOS function 65 - Log off


            Supported by: CP/Net.

/Enter with C=41h, E=network ID of server/

Returns A=0 if OK, or 0FFh if not logged on to the server anyway.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      BDOS function 66 - Send message


            Supported by: CP/Net.

/Enter with C=42h, DE=address of message./

The format of a normal CP/Net message is:

    [--FMT--]  Format code, 1 byte. 0-7 are standard CP/Net message formats.
    [--DID--]  Destination computer's network ID; normally 1 byte.
    [--SID--]  Source computer's network ID; normally 1 byte. 
    [--FNC--]  Function code; for standard messages, BDOS function number.
               Always 1 bytes. 
    [--SIZ--]  Message size - 1; normally 1 byte.
    [--MSG--]  Message data; normally 1-256 bytes.

The 8 standard message formats are treated as bitfields:

Bit 0: 0 for command, 1 for returned result.
Bit 1: Message data is more than 256 bytes. The "siz" field is a word and
       the data can be up to 64k.
Bit 2: Destination ID and source ID are words, not bytes.

Thus giving eight packet types:

0   Command    5 bytes header  1-256 bytes data   8-bit network IDs
1   Result     5 bytes header  1-256 bytes data   8-bit network IDs
2   Command    6 bytes header  1-64k data         8-bit network IDs
3   Result     6 bytes header  1-64k data         8-bit network IDs
4       Command    7 bytes header  1-256 bytes data  16-bit network IDs
5       Result     7 bytes header  1-256 bytes data  16-bit network IDs
6       Command    8 bytes header  1-64k data        16-bit network IDs
7       Result     8 bytes header  1-64k data        16-bit network IDs

In 8-bit systems, the NDOS only uses formats 0 and 1.

If the normal format is not used, the computers sending and receiving
the message must have a modified NIOS (Network I/O system) so they can
correctly handle the nonstandard message.

DRI also state that the format code should be greater than 128, so that
the message is not mistaken for a one sent by CP/Net itself. This seems
to imply that formats 128-135 should be used for messages in the 8
normal formats.

This call does not wait for a reply. Use function 67 <#67> to get a reply.

Returns BA = HL = 0FFFFh if an error occurred; else 0.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      BDOS function 67 - Receive message


            Supported by: CP/Net.

/Enter with C=43h, DE=address of buffer for message./

Message format is as given above.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      BDOS function 68 - Get network status


            Supported by: CP/Net.

/Enter with C=44h. Returns A=L=status byte./

    Bit 0 set if error transmitting data.
    Bit 1 set if error in received data.
    Bit 4 set if this computer is logged on to the network.

Bits 0 and 1 will be cleared after they have been read by this function.
------------------------------------------------------------------------


      BDOS function 69 - Get configuration table address


            Supported by: CP/Net.

/Enter with C=45h. Returns HL = address of table./

Format of the table is:

    DB  Network status byte <#68>
    DB  Computer's network ID
    DS  32  ;Redirection status of 16 drives
    DS  2   ;Redirection status of console
    DS  2   ;Redirection status of printer
    DB  no. of characters in printer buffer
    DS  5   ;Message header <#66> for printer output
    DB  printer device number
    DS  128 ;Printer buffer

A redirection status entry is two bytes:

    DB  Bit 7 set if device is on a different machine.
        Bit 6 set for "set up in disk".
        Bits 0-3 = drive number / device number on its local machine.
    DB  Network ID of the machine containing the device.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      BDOS function 70 - Set compatibility attributes


            Supported by: CP/Net-86, some 8-bit CP/Net versions.

/Enter with C=46h, E=compatibility info. No return./

The compatibility attributes are used to make a network server behave
more like a local drive on a single-user system, for compatibility with
ill-behaved programs. They are set from the "user attributes" F1'-F4' of
the current .COM file being run on the client machine.

F1'
    Disable file locking. There is no protection against two programs
    writing to the same file at the same time.
F2'
    File close operations write pending data and update the directory,
    but the file is not closed and can still be accessed.
F3'
    Disable FCB checksumming for file close operations.
F4'
    Disable FCB checksumming completely. This can cause filesystem damage.

These attributes are passed in E:

Bit 7: F1', disable locking.
Bit 6: F2', file close is partial.
Bit 5: F3', disable checksum on close file.
Bit 4: F4', disable checksum on all FCB operations (also set bits 5 & 6).

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      BDOS function 71 - Get server configuration


            Supported by: CP/Net-86, some 8-bit CP/Net versions.

/Enter with C=47h, E=server ID. Returns HL = address of table./

The table returned is:

    DB  server temporary file drive
    DB  server network status
    DB  server ID
    DB  max clients on this server
    DB  current no. of clients on this server
    DW  bitmap of clients logged in to the server
    DS  16  ;Requester ID table

Each call to this function uses the same buffer, so take a copy of the
data if calling this repeatedly.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      BDOS function 98 - Clean up disc


            Supported by: CP/M 3 (Internal?).

/Entered with C=62h. Returns A=0 if OK, 0FFh if current drive is invalid/

This function is called by the CCP when a program terminates. Open files
are closed; buffered data are not written, so files opened for writing
may be destroyed if not properly closed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      BDOS function 99 (F_TRUNCATE) - Truncate file


            Supported by: CP/M 3 and later.

/Entered with C=63h, DE=FCB address. Returns error codes in BA and HL./

Set the random record count of the FCB to the required file size in
records. If the file is password protected, point the DMA <#26> address
at the password. Returns A=0-3 for success, 0FFh for failure; H may
contain a hardware error <errors3.html> code.

Under Concurrent CP/M, if the F5' bit is not set and the file has an
extended file lock, the lock will be released when the file is
truncated. If F5' is set the lock stays.

This function can't be used to extend a file, only reduce it; and if the
file is sparse, then it must truncate it to a point where the last
record contains actual data.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      BDOS function 100 (DRV_SETLABEL) - Set directory label


            Supported by: MP/M II and later.

/Entered with C=64h, DE=FCB. Returns error codes in BA and HL./

The EX byte (FCB+0Ch) of the FCB should contain a flags byte:

Bit   Meaning if set
----------------------------------------
7     Passwords enabled
6     Stamp on access
5     Stamp on update
4     Stamp on creation
0     Assign password at DMA+8 to label.

This function may need a password at the DMA <#26> address, if there is
a label on the disc which has a password.

This function returns A=0 if OK, 0FFh for failure. H may contain a
hardware error <errors3.html> code.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      BDOS function 101 (DRV_GETLABEL) - Get directory label byte


            Supported by: MP/M II and later.

/Entered with C=65h, E=drive. Returns A=byte/

The byte returned has the following bits set:

Bit   Meaning if set
----------------------------------------
7     Passwords enabled
6     Stamp on access
5     Stamp on update
4     Stamp on creation
0     Directory label exists

If bit 0 is zero, the other bits are meaningless.

If a label does exist, it can be found using functions 17 <#17> and 18
<#18> with the first 13 bytes of the FCB set to "?", and checking for a
file whose user number is 32.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      BDOS function 102 (F_TIMEDATE) - Get file date and time


            Supported by: MP/M II and later.

/Entered with C=66h, DE=FCB address. Returns error codes in BA and HL./

Gets the file date and time stamps, and the password mode. The stamps
end up at FCB+18h (create or access), FCB+1Ch (update); the password
mode ends up at FCB+0Ch. This returns A=0-3 for success, or 0FFh for
failure. To tell whether a stamp is for creation or access, check the
directory label byte <#101>.

For information on the format of date and time stamps, see the date and
time calls <#104>. The password mode is documented in the next function.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      BDOS function 103 (F_WRITEXFCB) - Set file password and protection


            Supported by: MP/M II and later.

/Entered with C=67h, DE=FCB address. Returns error codes in BA and HL./

Sets file password and protection mode. Set FCB+0Ch to the required
password mode, and point the DMA address <#26> at the current password.
The password mode byte should have the following bits set:

Bit   Meaning if set
----------------------------------------
7     Reading requires password
6     Writing requires password
5     Deletion requires password
0     Assign password at DMA+8 to file.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      BDOS function 104 (T_SET) - Set date and time


            Supported by: MP/M II and later; Z80DOS, DOS+.

/Entered with C=68h, DE=address of time stamp./

The format of the time stamp is:

    DW  day ;Day 1 is 1 January 1978
    DB  hour    ;Packed BCD
    DB  minute  ;Packed BCD
[   DB  second  ;Packed BCD; only on Z80DOS and DOS+ ]

Under MP/M II and CP/M 3, the "seconds" counter will be reset to zero
when this function is called. Under Z80DOS and DOS+, the "seconds"
counter will be set from the time stamp.
------------------------------------------------------------------------


      BDOS function 105 (T_GET) - Get date and time


            Supported by: MP/M II and later; Z80DOS, DOS+.

/Entered with C=69h, DE=address of time stamp. Returns A=seconds (packed
BCD)./

The format of the time stamp is:

    DW  day ;Day 1 is 1 January 1978
    DB  hour    ;Packed BCD
    DB  minute  ;Packed BCD
[   DB  second  ;Packed BCD - only in Z80DOS and DOS+]

Under MP/M II and later versions, the "seconds" value will be returned
in A.
------------------------------------------------------------------------


      BDOS function 106 (F_PASSWD) - Set default password


            Supported by: MP/M II and above, CP/Net redirector.

/Entered with C=6Ah, DE=address of password./

Sets the default password, used for all file operations requiring
passwords when no password is given explicitly.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      BDOS function 107 (S_SERIAL) - Get serial number


            Supported by: MP/M II and above.

/Entered with C=6Bh, DE=address of buffer./

Stores a 6-byte serial number at the address given by DE. Usually this
number will be printable ASCII.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      BDOS function 108 (P_CODE) - Get/put program return code


            Supported by: CP/M 3 and above.

/Entered with C=6Ch, DE=code. Returns HL=code./

If DE=0FFFFh, then the current code is returned in HL. Otherwise, it is
set to the value in DE. Allowable values are:

00000h - 0FEFFh
    No fatal error
0FF00h - 0FF7Fh
    Fatal error
0FF80h - 0FFFCh
    Reserved
0FFFDh
    Program terminated because of a hardware error <errors3.html>.
0FFFEh
    Program terminated by Control-C.

If a program was chained by function 47 <#47>, an error code stored by
the previous program will be available to it. Otherwise the CCP sets the
return code to zero when it executes a program (some replacement CCPs do
not do this).

If the error code is 0FF00h or above, and the next command begins with
the character |:| then it will not be run.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      BDOS function 109 (C_MODE) - Set or get console mode


            Supported by: Personal CP/M; CP/M 3 and above

/Entered with C=6Dh, DE=mode or 0FFFFh. Returns HL=mode./

The mode is a bitmapped value. Under CP/M 3, the significant bits are:

0  If set, function 11 <#11> detects only ^C.
1  If set, ^S does not pause screen output.
2  If set, output does not expand tabs, nor is it echoed to the printer even 
   if ^P was pressed.
3  If set, ^C does not cause the program to terminate.
4  Behaves like bit 2. The BDOS source comments imply it also signifies 
   "escape sequence decoding" but whatever this is, it is not implemented in 
   the CP/M 3 BDOS.
7  Under CCP/M, if set, ^O does not act as a byte bucket.

8  } These form a 2-bit number controlling GET and SUBMIT:
9  }
    0  Return "conditional" status to function 11 <#11>.
             Programs using function 11 to test for interruption (eg SID) are 
             not interrupted, but those using it to test for input do get the

available. This is automatically called if any console I/O function is
used while the current process is not attached to the console.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      BDOS function 147 (C_DETACH) - Detach console


            Supported by: MP/M, Concurrent CP/M, CP/M-86 v4.

/Entered with C=93h./

The program is disconnected from the screen and keyboard and must run in
the background.

Under CP/M-86 v4, attempting to use the keyboard will cause the program
to be terminated. Note that backgrounded programs cannot use the |INT
2/n/h| DOS-like calls, only the |INT E0h| CP/M calls. Limited screen
output can be achieved using XIOS function 8 (write to status line).

Under MP/M and CCP/M, attempting to output to the screen will cause
function 146 <#146> to be invoked.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

      BDOS function 150 (P_CLI) - Send CLI command


            Supported by: MP/M, Concurrent CP/M

/Entered with C=96h, DE = address of command-line buffer. Returns A=0 if
OK, 0FFh if failed./

This executes a command line, either by passing it to a loaded Resident
System Process or by launching a program. If the current process is
attached to its default console, it will be detached and the child
process (or RSP) will be given it. Before it takes the console back, it
should raise its priority to less than 198, take the console, and set
priority back to 200.

The format of the command-line buffer is:

        DB   0      ;Reserved
        DS   128    ;128 bytes for 0-terminated command line
        DB   0      ;Reserved

      BDOS function 152 (F_PARSE) - Parse filename


            Supported by: MP/M, CP/M 3 and higher.

/Entered with C=98h, DE=address of PFCB. Returns codes in HL./

This parses an ASCII filename to a FCB. The format of the PFCB is:

    DEFW    ascii-address
    DEFW    fcb-address

The value returned in HL is 0FFFFh if the ASCII filename was invalid; 0
if the ASCII filename was terminated with a zero or a carriage return;
and otherwise the address of the next character after the filename.

The filename can be of any form up to the full /d:filename.typ;password/
(password only under CP/M 3 and above). When the filename is parsed, the
password is copied to FCB+10h, with its length at FCB+1Ah.

Under ZPM3, the filename may be of the form /du:filename.typ;password/;
FCB+0Dh will be 0 if no user number was specified, or 1+number
otherwise. If a Z-System is loaded, ZPM3 can also parse filenames of the
form /dir:filename.typ;password/.

*BUG:* ZPM3 (version N10) puts the password at FCB+0Ch rather than
FCB+10h, overwriting the user number stored at FCB+0Dh. It does not zero
the last four bytes of the FCB, while CP/M does.

The filename can be terminated by any of: |space tab cr nul ; = > < . :
, [ ] / || .

/Entered with C=9Dh, DE = address of abort parameter block. Returns A=0
if OK, 0FFh if failed./

Terminates a process by force. The abort parameter block is formed:

        DW      pd              ;Process ID of the process to be
                                ;terminated. If this is zero, uses 
                                ;the 'name' and 'cns' fields for a match.
        DW      term            ;Termination code (see P_TERM <#143>)
        DB      cns             ;(if PD=0) Default console of process to be 
                                ;terminated.
        DB      0
        DB      '  name  '      ;(if PD=0) Name of process to be terminated.

The low byte of the termination code is 0FFh to abort a system process,
other values to abort a user process.

rather than the internal BDOS version. Numbers include:

1012h - DOSPLUS v1.2
1021h - DOSPLUS v2.1
1121h - MP/M-86 v2.1
1420h - Concurrent CP/M v2.0

      BDOS function 175 - Return real drive ID


            Supported by: DOSPLUS v2.1

/Entered with CL=AFh, DL=drive number (0 => A:, 1 => B: etc.)/

DOSPLUS treats drive N:, O: and P: as floating drives, which can be
assigned to paths on other drives (the same sort of thing as SUBST under
MS-DOS).

  * If DL is the number of a non-floating drive, this will return
    AH=BH=0 and AL=BL=drive number passed in. This is true even if the
    drive in question does not exist.
  * If DL is the number of a floating drive which has not been assigned,
    this will return AH=BH=0 and AL=BL=drive number of the boot drive.
  * If DL is the number of a floating drive which has not been assigned,
    this will return AH=BH=0 and AL=BL=drive number of the host drive.
  * If DL is out of range, this will return AX=BX=0FFFFh and CX=17h.

For example, after the command CD P:=B:\MYDIR, this call will return
AX=BX=0001h (B:) if it was entered with DL=0Fh (P:).

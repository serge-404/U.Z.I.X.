      DESCRIPTION

    /Vi/ (visual) is a display oriented text editor based on /ex/(1).
    /Ex/ and /vi/ run the same code; it is possible to get to the
    command mode of /ex/ from within /vi/ and vice-versa.

    The /view/ command is identical to /vi/ except that files are opened
    read-only. The /vedit/ command is also identical, but sets some
    options to values more useful for novices.

    The following options are accepted:
    *-c*/ command/ or *+*/command/
     	Execute /command/ when editing begins.
    *-l* 	Start in a special mode useful for the /Lisp/ programming
    language.
    *-r*/ [filename]/ or *-L*
     	When no argument is supplied with this option, all files to be
    recovered are listed and the editor exits immediately. If a
    /filename/ is specified, the corresponding temporary file is opened
    in recovery mode.
    *-R* 	Files are opened read-only when this option is given.
    *-s* or *-* 	Script mode; all feedback for interactive editing is
    disabled. EXINIT and /.exrc/ files are not processed.
    *-t*/ tagstring/
     	Read the /tags/ file, then choose the file and position specified
    by /tagstring/ for editing.
    *-V* 	Echo command input to standard error, unless it originates
    from a terminal.
    *-w*/ size/ 	Specify the size of the editing window for visual mode.
    The /Introduction to Display Editing with Vi/ provides full details
    on using /vi./
    Most of the /ex/ commands are available in /visual/ mode when
    prefixed by a *:* character. See /ex/(1) for a description of them.
    The following gives the uses the editor makes of each character. The
    characters are presented in their order in the ASCII character set:
    Control characters come first, then most special characters, then
    the digits, upper and then lower case characters.
    For each character we tell a meaning it has as a command and any
    meaning it has during an insert. If it has only meaning as a
    command, then only this is discussed. Section numbers in parentheses
    indicate where the character is discussed in ''An Introduction to
    Display Editing with Vi''; a 'f' after the section number means that
    the character is mentioned in a footnote.
    *^@* 	Not a command character. If typed as the first character of an
    insertion it is replaced with the last text inserted, and the insert
    terminates. Only 128 characters are saved from the last insert; if
    more characters were inserted the mechanism is not available. A *^@*
    cannot be part of the file due to the editor implementation (7.5f).
    *^A* 	Unused.
    *^B* 	Backward window. A count specifies repetition. Two lines of
    continuity are kept if possible (2.1, 6.1, 7.2).
    *^C* 	Unused.
    *^D* 	As a command, scrolls down a half-window of text. A count
    gives the number of (logical) lines to scroll, and is remembered for
    future *^D* and *^U* commands (2.1, 7.2). During an insert, backtabs
    over /autoindent/ white space at the beginning of a line (6.6, 7.5);
    this white space cannot be backspaced over.
    *^E* 	Exposes one more line below the current screen in the file,
    leaving the cursor where it is if possible.
    *^F* 	Forward window. A count specifies repetition. Two lines of
    continuity are kept if possible (2.1, 6.1, 7.2).
    *^G* 	Equivalent to *:f*CR, printing the current file, whether it
    has been modified, the current line number and the number of lines
    in the file, and the percentage of the way through the file.
    *^H (*BS*)*
     	Same as *left arrow*. (See *h*). During an insert, eliminates the
    last input character, backing over it but not erasing it; it remains
    so the user can see what he typed if he wishes to type something
    only slightly different (3.1, 7.5).
    *^I (*TAB*)*
     	Not a command character. When inserted it prints as some number of
    spaces. When the cursor is at a tab character it rests at the last
    of the spaces which represent the tab. The spacing of tabstops is
    controlled by the /tabstop/ option (4.1, 6.6).
    *^J (*LF*)* 	Same as *down arrow* (see *j*).
    *^K* 	Unused.
    *^L* 	The ASCII formfeed character, this causes the screen to be
    cleared and redrawn. This is useful after a transmission error, if
    characters typed by a program other than the editor scramble the
    screen, or after output is stopped by an interrupt (5.4, 7.2f).
    *^M (*CR*)* 	A carriage return advances to the next line, at the
    first non-white position in the line. Given a count, it advances
    that many lines (2.3). During an insert, a CR causes the insert to
    continue onto another line (3.1).
    *^N* 	Same as *down arrow* (see *j*).
    *^O* 	Unused.
    *^P* 	Same as *up arrow* (see *k*).
    *^Q* 	Not a command character. In input mode, *^Q* quotes the next
    character, the same as *^V ,* except that some teletype drivers will
    eat the *^Q* so that the editor never sees it.
    *^R* 	Redraws the current screen, eliminating logical lines not
    corresponding to physical lines (lines with only a single @
    character on them). On hardcopy terminals in /open/ mode, retypes
    the current line (5.4, 7.2, 7.8).
    *^S* 	Unused. Some teletype drivers use *^S* to suspend output until
    *^Q is pressed.*
    *^T* 	Not a command character. During an insert, with /autoindent/
    set and at the beginning of the line, inserts /shiftwidth/ white space.
    *^U* 	Scrolls the screen up, inverting *^D* which scrolls down.
    Counts work as they do for *^D*, and the previous scroll amount is
    common to both. On a dumb terminal, *^U* will often necessitate
    clearing and redrawing the screen further back in the file (2.1, 7.2).
    *^V* 	Not a command character. In input mode, quotes the next
    character so that it is possible to insert non-printing and special
    characters into the file (4.2, 7.5).
    *^W* 	Not a command character. During an insert, backs up as *b*
    would in command mode; the deleted characters remain on the display
    (see *^H*) (7.5).
    *^X* 	Unused.
    *^Y* 	Exposes one more line above the current screen, leaving the
    cursor where it is if possible. (No mnemonic value for this key;
    however, it is next to *^U* which scrolls up a bunch.)
    *^Z* 	If supported by the Unix system, stops the editor, exiting to
    the top level shell. Same as *:stop*CR. Otherwise, unused.
    *^[ (*ESC*)*
     	Cancels a partially formed command, such as a *z* when no
    following character has yet been given; terminates inputs on the
    last line (read by commands such as *: /* and *?*); ends insertions
    of new text into the buffer. If an ESC is given when quiescent in
    command state, the editor rings the bell or flashes the screen. The
    user can thus hit ESC if he doesn't know what is happening till the
    editor rings the bell. If the user doesn't know whether he is in
    insert mode he can type ESC*a*, and then material to be input; the
    material will be inserted correctly whether or not he was in insert
    mode when he started (1.6, 3.1, 7.5).
    *^\* 	Unused.
    *^]* 	Searches for the word which is after the cursor as a tag.
    Equivalent to typing *:ta*, this word, and then a CR. Mnemonically,
    this command is '' right to'' (7.3).
    *^^* 	Equivalent to *:e #*CR, returning to the previous position in
    the last edited file, or editing a file which the user specified if
    he got a 'No write since last change diagnostic' and does not want
    to have to type the file name again (7.3). (The user has to do a
    *:w* before *^^* will work in this case. If he does not wish to
    write the file he should do *:e! #*CR instead.)
    *^_* 	Unused. Reserved as the command character for the Tektronix
    4025 and 4027 terminal.
    **SPACE** 	Same as *right arrow* (see *l*).
    *!* 	An operator, which processes lines from the buffer with
    reformatting commands. Follow *!* with the object to be processed,
    and then the command name terminated by CR. Doubling *!* and
    preceding it by a count causes count lines to be filtered; otherwise
    the count is passed on to the object after the *!*. Thus
    *2!}*/fmt/CR reformats the next two paragraphs by running them
    through the program /fmt/. If working on LISP, the command
    *!%*/grind/CR, given at the beginning of a function, will run the
    text of the function through the LISP grinder (6.7, 7.3). To read a
    file or the output of a command into the buffer *:r* (7.3) can be
    used. To simply execute a command, *:!* (7.3). Precedes a named
    buffer specification. There are named buffers *1-9* used for saving
    deleted text and named buffers *a-z* into which the user can place
    text (4.3, 6.3)
    *#* 	The macro character which, when followed by a number, will
    substitute for a function key on terminals without function keys
    (6.9). In input mode, if this is the erase character, it will delete
    the last character typed in input mode, and must be preceded with a
    *\* to insert it, since it normally backs over the last input
    character.
    *$* 	Moves to the end of the current line. If the *list* option is
    set, then the end of each line will be shown by printing a *$* after
    the end of the displayed text in the line. Given a count, advances
    to the count'th following end of line; thus *2$* advances to the end
    of the following line.
    *%* 	Moves to the parenthesis or brace *{ }* which balances the
    parenthesis or brace at the current cursor position.
    *&* 	A synonym for *:&*CR, by analogy with the /ex/ *&* command.
    *´* 	When followed by a *´* returns to the previous context at the
    beginning of a line. The previous context is set whenever the
    current line is moved in a non-relative way. When followed by a
    letter *a*-*z*, returns to the line which was marked with this
    letter with a *m* command, at the first non-white character in the
    line. (2.2, 5.3). When used with an operator such as *d*, the
    operation takes place over complete lines; if *`* is used, the
    operation takes place from the exact marked place to the current
    cursor position within the line.
    *(* 	Retreats to the beginning of a sentence, or to the beginning of
    a LISP s-expression if the /lisp/ option is set. A sentence ends at
    a *. !* or *?* which is followed by either the end of a line or by
    two spaces. Any number of closing *) ] "* and *´* characters may
    appear after the *. !* or *?*, and before the spaces or end of line.
    Sentences also begin at paragraph and section boundaries (see *{*
    and *[[* below). A count advances that many sentences (4.2, 6.8).
    *)* 	Advances to the beginning of a sentence. A count repeats the
    effect. See *(* above for the definition of a sentence (4.2, 6.8).
    *** 	Unused.
    *+* 	Same as CR when used as a command.
    *,* 	Reverse of the last *f F t* or *T* command, looking the other
    way in the current line. Especially useful after hitting too many
    *;* characters. A count repeats the search.
    *-* 	Retreats to the previous line at the first non-white character.
    This is the inverse of *+* and RETURN. If the line moved to is not
    on the screen, the screen is scrolled, or cleared and redrawn if
    this is not possible. If a large amount of scrolling would be
    required the screen is also cleared and redrawn, with the current
    line at the center (2.3).
    *.* 	Repeats the last command which changed the buffer. Especially
    useful when deleting words or lines; the user can delete some
    words/lines and then hit *.* to delete more and more words/lines.
    Given a count, it passes it on to the command being repeated. Thus
    after a *2dw*, *3.* deletes three words (3.3, 6.3, 7.2, 7.4).
    */* 	Reads a string from the last line on the screen, and scans
    forward for the next occurrence of this string. The normal input
    editing sequences may be used during the input on the bottom line;
    an returns to command state without ever searching. The search
    begins when the user hits CR to terminate the pattern; the cursor
    moves to the beginning of the last line to indicate that the search
    is in progress; the search may then be terminated with a DEL or RUB,
    or by backspacing when at the beginning of the bottom line,
    returning the cursor to its initial position. Searches normally wrap
    end-around to find a string anywhere in the buffer.
    	When used with an operator the enclosed region is normally
    affected. By mentioning an offset from the line matched by the
    pattern the user can force whole lines to be affected. To do this a
    pattern with a closing a closing */* and then an offset *+*/n/ or
    *-*/n/ must be given.
    	To include the character */* in the search string, it must be
    escaped with a preceding *\*. A *^* at the beginning of the pattern
    forces the match to occur at the beginning of a line only; this
    speeds the search. A *$* at the end of the pattern forces the match
    to occur at the end of a line only. More extended pattern matching
    is available, see section 7.4; unless *nomagic* ist set in the
    /.exrc/ file the user will have to preceed the characters *. [ **
    and *~* in the search pattern with a *\* to get them to work as one
    would naively expect (1.6, 2.2, 6.1, 7.2, 7.4).
    *0* 	Moves to the first character on the current line. Also used, in
    forming numbers, after an initial *1*-*9*.
    *1-9* 	Used to form numeric arguments to commands (2.3, 7.2).
    *:* 	A prefix to a set of commands for file and option manipulation
    and escapes to the system. Input is given on the bottom line and
    terminated with an CR, and the command then executed. The user can
    return to where he was by hitting DEL or RUB if he hit *:*
    accidentally (see /ex/(1) and primarily 6.2 and 7.3).
    *;* 	Repeats the last single character find which used *f F t* or
    *T*. A count iterates the basic scan (4.1).
    *<* 	An operator which shifts lines left one /shiftwidth/, normally
    8 spaces. Like all operators, affects lines when repeated, as in
    *<<*. Counts are passed through to the basic object, thus *3<<*
    shifts three lines (6.6, 7.2).
    *=* 	Reindents line for LISP, as though they were typed in with
    /lisp/ and /autoindent/ set (6.8).
    *>* 	An operator which shifts lines right one /shiftwidth/, normally
    8 spaces. Affects lines when repeated as in *>>*. Counts repeat the
    basic object (6.6, 7.2).
    *?* 	Scans backwards, the opposite of */*. See the */* description
    above for details on scanning (2.2, 6.1, 7.4).
    *@* 	A macro character (6.9). If this is the kill character, it must
    be escaped with a \ to type it in during input mode, as it normally
    backs over the input given on the current line (3.1, 3.4, 7.5).
    *A* 	Appends at the end of line, a synonym for *$a* (7.2).
    *B* 	Backs up a word, where words are composed of non-blank
    sequences, placing the cursor at the beginning of the word. A count
    repeats the effect (2.4).
    *C* 	Changes the rest of the text on the current line; a synonym for
    *c$*.
    *D* 	Deletes the rest of the text on the current line; a synonym for
    *d$*.
    *E* 	Moves forward to the end of a word, defined as blanks and
    non-blanks, like *B* and *W*. A count repeats the effect.
    *F* 	Finds a single following character, backwards in the current
    line. A count repeats this search that many times (4.1).
    *G* 	Goes to the line number given as preceding argument, or the end
    of the file if no preceding count is given. The screen is redrawn
    with the new current line in the center if necessary (7.2).
    *H* 	*Home arrow*. Homes the cursor to the top line on the screen.
    If a count is given, then the cursor is moved to the count'th line
    on the screen. In any case the cursor is moved to the first
    non-white character on the line. If used as the target of an
    operator, full lines are affected (2.3, 3.2).
    *I* 	Inserts at the beginning of a line; a synonym for *^i*.
    *J* 	Joins together lines, supplying appropriate white space: one
    space between words, two spaces after a *.*, and no spaces at all if
    the first character of the joined on line is *)*. A count causes
    that many lines to be joined rather than the default two (6.5, 7.1f).
    *K* 	Unused.
    *L* 	Moves the cursor to the first non-white character of the last
    line on the screen. With a count, to the first non-white of the
    count'th line from the bottom. Operators affect whole lines when
    used with *L* (2.3).
    *M* 	Moves the cursor to the middle line on the screen, at the first
    non-white position on the line (2.3).
    *N* 	Scans for the next match of the last pattern given to */* or
    *?*, but in the reverse direction; this is the reverse of *n*.
    *O* 	Opens a new line above the current line and inputs text there
    up to an ESC. A count can be used on dumb terminals to specify a
    number of lines to be opened; this is generally obsolete, as the
    /slowopen/ option works better (3.1).
    *P* 	Puts the last deleted text back before/above the cursor. The
    text goes back as whole lines above the cursor if it was deleted as
    whole lines. Otherwise the text is inserted between the characters
    before and at the cursor. May be preceded by a named buffer
    specification *"*/x/ to retrieve the contents of the buffer; buffers
    *1*-*9* contain deleted material, buffers *a*-*z* are available for
    general use (6.3).
    *Q* 	Quits from /vi/ to /ex/ command mode. In this mode, whole lines
    form commands, ending with a RETURN. One can give all the *:*
    commands; the editor supplies the *:* as a prompt (7.7).
    *R* 	Replaces characters on the screen with characters typed
    (overlay fashion). Terminates with an ESC.
    *S* 	Changes whole lines, a synonym for *cc*. A count substitutes
    for that many lines. The lines are saved in the numeric buffers, and
    erased on the screen before the substitution begins.
    *T* 	Takes a single following character, locates the character
    before the cursor in the current line, and places the cursor just
    after that character. A count repeats the effect. Most useful with
    operators such as *d* (4.1).
    *U* 	Restores the current line to its state before the user started
    changing it (3.5).
    *V* 	Unused.
    *W* 	Moves forward to the beginning of a word in the current line,
    where words are defined as sequences of blank/non-blank characters.
    A count repeats the effect (2.4).
    *X* 	Deletes the character before the cursor. A count repeats the
    effect, but only characters on the current line are deleted.
    *Y* 	Yanks a copy of the current line into the unnamed buffer, to be
    put back by a later *p* or *P*; a very useful synonym for *yy*. A
    count yanks that many lines. May be preceded by a buffer name to put
    lines in that buffer (7.4).
    *ZZ* 	Exits the editor. (Same as *:x*CR.) If any changes have been
    made, the buffer is written out to the current file. Then the editor
    quits.
    *[[* 	Backs up to the previous section boundary. A section begins at
    each macro in the /sections/ option, normally a '.NH' or '.SH' and
    also at lines which which start with a formfeed *^L*. Lines
    beginning with *{* also stop *[[*; this makes it useful for looking
    backwards, a function at a time, in C programs. If the option /lisp/
    is set, stops at each *(* at the beginning of a line, and is thus
    useful for moving backwards at the top level LISP objects. (4.2,
    6.1, 6.6, 7.2).
    *\* 	Unused.
    *]]* 	Forward to a section boundary, see *[[* for a definition (4.2,
    6.1, 6.6, 7.2).
    *^* 	Moves to the first non-white position on the current line (4.4).
    *_* 	Unused.
    *`* 	When followed by a *`* returns to the previous context. The
    previous context is set whenever the current line is moved in a
    non-relative way. When followed by a letter *a*-*z*, returns to the
    position which was marked with this letter with a *m* command. When
    used with an operator such as *d*, the operation takes place from
    the exact marked place to the current position within the line; if
    using *´*, the operation takes place over complete lines (2.2, 5.3).
    *a* 	Appends arbitrary text after the current cursor position; the
    insert can continue onto multiple lines by using RETURN within the
    insert. A count causes the inserted text to be replicated, but only
    if the inserted text is all on one line. The insertion terminates
    with an ESC (3.1, 7.2).
    *b* 	Backs up to the beginning of a word in the current line. A word
    is a sequence of alphanumerics, or a sequence of special characters.
    A count repeats the effect (2.4).
    *c* 	An operator which changes the following object, replacing it
    with the following input text up to an ESC. If more than part of a
    single line is affected, the text which is changed away is saved in
    the numeric named buffers. If only part of the current line is
    affected, then the last character to be changed away is marked with
    a *$*. A count causes that many objects to be affected, thus both
    *3c)* and *c3)* change the following three sentences (7.4).
    *d* 	An operator which deletes the following object. If more than
    part of a line is affected, the text is saved in the numeric
    buffers. A count causes that many objects to be affected; thus *3dw*
    is the same as *d3w* (3.3, 3.4, 4.1, 7.4).
    *e* 	Advances to the end of the next word, defined as for *b* and
    *w*. A count repeats the effect (2.4, 3.1).
    *f* 	Finds the first instance of the next character following the
    cursor on the current line. A count repeats the find (4.1).
    *g* 	Unused.

    Arrow keys *h*, *j*, *k*, *l*, and *H*.

    *h* 	*Left arrow .* Moves the cursor one character to the left. Like
    the other arrow keys, either *h*, the *left arrow* key, or one of
    the synonyms (*^H*) has the same effect. A count repeats the effect
    (3.1, 7.5).
    *i* 	Inserts text before the cursor, otherwise like *a* (7.2).
    *j* 	*Down arrow .* Moves the cursor one line down in the same
    column. If the position does not exist, /vi/ comes as close as
    possible to the same column. Synonyms include *^J* (linefeed) and
    *^N .*
    *k* 	*Up arrow .* Moves the cursor one line up. *^P* is a synonym.
    *l* 	*Right arrow .* Moves the cursor one character to the right.
    SPACE is a synonym.
    *m* 	Marks the current position of the cursor in the mark register
    which is specified by the next character *a*-*z*. The user can
    return to this position or use it with an operator using *`* or *´*
    (5.3).
    *n* 	Repeats the last */* or *?* scanning commands (2.2).
    *o* 	Opens new lines below the current line; otherwise like *O* (3.1).
    *p* 	Puts text after/below the cursor; otherwise like *P* (6.3).
    *q* 	Unused.
    *r* 	Replaces the single character at the cursor with a single
    character typed. The new character may be a RETURN; this is the
    easiest way to split lines. A count replaces each of the following
    count characters with the single character given; see *R* above
    which is the more usually useful iteration of *r* (3.2).
    *s* 	Changes the single character under the cursor to the text which
    follows up to an ESC; given a count, that many characters from the
    current line are changed. The last character to be changed is marked
    with *$* as in *c* (3.2).
    *t* 	Advances the cursor upto the character before the next
    character typed. Most useful with operators such as *d* and *c* to
    delete the characters up to a following character. One can use *.*
    to delete more if this doesn't delete enough the first time (4.1).
    *u* 	Undoes the last change made to the current buffer. If repeated,
    will alternate between these two states, thus is its own inverse.
    When used after an insert which inserted text on more than one line,
    the lines are saved in the numeric named buffers (3.5).
    *v* 	Unused.
    *w* 	Advances to the beginning of the next word, as defined by *b*
    (2.4).
    *x* 	Deletes the single character under the cursor. With a count
    deletes deletes that many characters forward from the cursor
    position, but only on the current line (6.5).
    *y* 	An operator, yanks the following object into the unnamed
    temporary buffer. If preceded by a named buffer specification,
    *"*/x/, the text is placed in that buffer also. Text can be
    recovered by a later *p* or *P* (7.4).
    *z* 	Redraws the screen with the current line placed as specified by
    the following character: RETURN specifies the top of the screen, *.*
    the center of the screen, and *-* at the bottom of the screen. A
    count may be given after the *z* and before the following character
    to specify the new screen size for the redraw. A count before the
    *z* gives the number of the line to place in the center of the
    screen instead of the default current line. (5.4)
    *{* 	Retreats to the beginning of the beginning of the preceding
    paragraph. A paragraph begins at each macro in the /paragraphs/
    option, normally '.IP', '.LP', '.PP', '.QP' and '.bp'. A paragraph
    also begins after a completely empty line, and at each section
    boundary (see *[[* above) (4.2, 6.8, 7.6).
    *|* 	Places the cursor on the character in the column specified by
    the count (7.1, 7.2).
    *}* 	Advances to the beginning of the next paragraph. See *{* for
    the definition of paragraph (4.2, 6.8, 7.6).
    *~* 	Switches the case of the given count of characters starting
    from the current cursor position to the end of the current line.
    Non-alphabetic characters remain unchanged.
    *^? (*DEL***)*
     	Interrupts the editor, returning it to command accepting state
    (1.6, 7.5).


      ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

    The following environment variables affect the behaviour of vi:
    *COLUMNS*
     	Overrides the system-supplied number of terminal columns.
    *EXINIT* 	Contains commands to execute at editor startup. If this
    variable is present, the /.exrc/ file in the user's home directory
    is ignored.
    *HOME* 	Used to locate the editor startup file.
    *LANG*, *LC_ALL*
     	See /locale/(7).
    *LC_CTYPE*
     	Determines the mapping of bytes to characters, types of
    characters, case conversion and composition of character classes in
    regular expressions.
    *LC_MESSAGES*
     	Sets the language used for diagnostic and informal messages.
    *LINES* 	Overrides the system-supplied number of terminal lines.
    *NLSPATH*
     	See /catopen/(3).
    *SHELL* 	The program file used to execute external commands.
    *TERM* 	Determines the terminal type.


      FILES

    */usr/libexec/expreserve*
     	preserve command
    */usr/libexec/exrecover*
     	recover command
    */etc/termcap*
     	describes capabilities of terminals
    *$HOME/.exrc*
     	editor startup file
    */var/tmp/Ex*/nnnnnnnnnn/
     	editor temporary
    */var/tmp/Rx*/nnnnnnnnnn/
     	named buffer temporary
    */var/preserve*
     	preservation directory

      NOTES

    Software tabs using *^T* work only immediately after the /autoindent./

    Left and right shifts on intelligent terminals don't make use of
    insert and delete character operations in the terminal.

    The /wrapmargin/ option can be fooled since it looks at output
    columns when blanks are typed. If a long word passes through the
    margin and onto the next line without a break, then the line won't
    be broken.

    Insert/delete within a line can be slow if tabs are present on
    intelligent terminals, since the terminals need help in doing this
    correctly.

    The /source/ command does not work when executed as *:source*; there
    is no way to use the *:append*, *:change*, and *:insert* commands,
    since it is not possible to give more than one line of input to a
    *:* escape. To use these on a *:global* one must *Q* to /ex/ command
    mode, execute them, and then reenter the screen editor with /vi/ or
    /open./

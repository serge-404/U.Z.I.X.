      DESCRIPTION

    /Ex/ is the root of a family of editors: /edit,/ /ex/ and /vi./ /Ex/
    is a superset of /ed,/ with the most notable extension being a
    display editing facility. Display based editing on CRT terminals is
    the focus of /vi/.

    For those who have not used /ed,/ or for casual users, the editor
    /edit/ may be convenient. It avoids some of the complexities of /ex/
    used mostly by systems programmers and persons very familiar with /ed./

    The following options are accepted:
    *-c*/ command/ or *+*/command/
     	Execute /command/ when editing begins.
    *-l* 	Start in a special mode useful for the /Lisp/ programming
    language.
    *-r*/ [filename]/ or *-L*
     	When no argument is supplied with this option, all files to be
    recovered are listed and the editor exits immediately. If a
    /filename/ is specified, the corresponding temporary file is opened
    in recovery mode.
    *-R* 	Files are opened read-only when this option is given.
    *-s* or *-* 	Script mode; all feedback for interactive editing is
    disabled. EXINIT and /.exrc/ files are not processed.
    *-t*/ tagstring/
     	Read the /tags/ file, then choose the file and position specified
    by /tagstring/ for editing.
    *-v* 	Start in visual mode even if called as /ex/.
    *-V* 	Echo command input to standard error, unless it originates
    from a terminal.
    *-w*/ size/ 	Specify the size of the editing window for visual mode.


            File manipulation

    /Ex/ is normally editing the contents of a single file, whose name
    is recorded in the /current/ file name. /Ex/ performs all editing
    actions in a buffer (actually a temporary file) into which the text
    of the file is initially read. Changes made to the buffer have no
    effect on the file being edited unless and until the buffer contents
    are written out to the file with a /write/ command. After the buffer
    contents are written, the previous contents of the written file are
    no longer accessible. When a file is edited, its name becomes the
    current file name, and its contents are read into the buffer.

    The current file is almost always considered to be /edited./ This
    means that the contents of the buffer are logically connected with
    the current file name, so that writing the current buffer contents
    onto that file, even if it exists, is a reasonable action. If the
    current file is not /edited/ then /ex/ will not normally write on it
    if it already exists.

    For saving blocks of text while editing, and especially when editing
    more than one file, /ex/ has a group of named buffers. These are
    similar to the normal buffer, except that only a limited number of
    operations are available on them. The buffers have names /a/ through
    /z./


            Exceptional Conditions

    When errors occur /ex/ (optionally) rings the terminal bell and, in
    any case, prints an error diagnostic. If the primary input is from a
    file, editor processing will terminate. If an interrupt signal is
    received, /ex/ prints ''Interrupt'' and returns to its command
    level. If the primary input is a file, then /ex/ will exit when this
    occurs.

    If a hangup signal is received and the buffer has been modified
    since it was last written out, or if the system crashes, either the
    editor (in the first case) or the system (after it reboots in the
    second) will attempt to preserve the buffer. The next time the user
    logs in he should be able to recover the work he was doing, losing
    at most a few lines of changes from the last point before the hangup
    or editor crash. To recover a file one can use the *-r* option. If
    one was editing the file /resume,/ then he should change to the
    directory where he were when the crash occurred, giving the command

        *ex -r*/resume/

    After checking that the retrieved file is indeed ok, he can /write/
    it over the previous contents of that file.

    The user will normally get mail from the system telling him when a
    file has been saved after a crash. The command

        *ex* -*r*

    will print a list of the files which have been saved for the user. 


            Editing modes

    /Ex/ has five distinct modes. The primary mode is /command/ mode.
    Commands are entered in command mode when a ':' prompt is present,
    and are executed each time a complete line is sent. In /text input/
    mode /ex/ gathers input lines and places them in the file. The
    /append,/ /insert,/ and /change/ commands use text input mode. No
    prompt is printed when in text input mode. This mode is left by
    typing a '.' alone at the beginning of a line, and /command/ mode
    resumes.

    The last three modes are /open/ and /visual/ modes, entered by the
    commands of the same name, and, within open and visual modes /text
    insertion/ mode. /Open/ and /visual/ modes allow local editing
    operations to be performed on the text in the file. The /open/
    command displays one line at a time on any terminal while /visual/
    works on CRT terminals with random positioning cursors, using the
    screen as a (single) window for file editing changes. These modes
    are described (only) in /An Introduction to Display Editing with Vi./


            Command structure

    Most command names are English words, and initial prefixes of the
    words are acceptable abbreviations. The ambiguity of abbreviations
    is resolved in favor of the more commonly used commands.

    Most commands accept prefix addresses specifying the lines in the
    file upon which they are to have effect. The forms of these
    addresses will be discussed below. A number of commands also may
    take a trailing /count/ specifying the number of lines to be
    involved in the command. Thus the command ''10p'' will print the
    tenth line in the buffer while ''delete 5'' will delete five lines
    from the buffer, starting with the current line.

    Some commands take other information or parameters, this information
    always being given after the command name.

    A number of commands have two distinct variants. The variant form of
    the command is invoked by placing an '!' immediately after the
    command name. Some of the default variants may be controlled by
    options; in this case, the '!' serves to toggle the default.

    The characters '#', 'p' and 'l' may be placed after many commands (A
    'p' or 'l' must be preceded by a blank or tab except in the single
    special case 'dp'). In this case, the command abbreviated by these
    characters is executed after the command completes. Since /ex/
    normally prints the new current line after each change, 'p' is
    rarely necessary. Any number of '+' or '-' characters may also be
    given with these flags. If they appear, the specified offset is
    applied to the current line value before the printing command is
    executed.

    It is possible to give editor commands which are ignored. This is
    useful when making complex editor scripts for which comments are
    desired. The comment character is the double quote: ". Any command
    line beginning with " is ignored. Comments beginning with " may also
    be placed at the ends of commands, except in cases where they could
    be confused as part of text (shell escapes and the substitute and
    map commands).

    More than one command may be placed on a line by separating each
    pair of commands by a '|' character. However the /global/ commands,
    comments, and the shell escape '!' must be the last command on a
    line, as they are not terminated by a '|'.


            Command addressing

    *.* 	The current line. Most commands leave the current line as the
    last line which they affect. The default address for most commands
    is the current line, thus '*.*' is rarely used alone as an address.
    /n/ 	The /n/th line in the editor's buffer, lines being numbered
    sequentially from 1.
    *$* 	The last line in the buffer.
    *%* 	An abbreviation for ''1,$'', the entire buffer.
    /+n/ /-n/ 	An offset relative to the current buffer line. The forms
    '.+3' '+3' and '+++' are all equivalent; if the current line is line
    100 they all address line 103.
    */*/pat/*/* *?*/pat/*?* 	Scan forward and backward respectively for
    a line containing /pat/, a regular expression (as defined below).
    The scans normally wrap around the end of the buffer. If all that is
    desired is to print the next line containing /pat/, then the
    trailing */* or *?* may be omitted. If /pat/ is omitted or
    explicitly empty, then the last regular expression specified is
    located. The forms *\/* and *\?* scan using the last regular
    expression used in a scan; after a substitute *//* and *??* would
    scan using the substitute's regular expression.
    *´´* *´*/x/ 	Before each non-relative motion of the current line
    '*.*', the previous current line is marked with a tag, subsequently
    referred to as '´´'. This makes it easy to refer or return to this
    previous context. Marks may also be established by the /mark/
    command, using single lower case letters /x/ and the marked lines
    referred to as '´/x/'.

    Addresses to commands consist of a series of addressing primitives,
    separated by ',' or ';'. Such address lists are evaluated
    left-to-right. When addresses are separated by ';' the current line
    '*.*' is set to the value of the previous addressing expression
    before the next address is interpreted. If more addresses are given
    than the command requires, then all but the last one or two are
    ignored. If the command takes two addresses, the first addressed
    line must precede the second in the buffer.

    Null address specifications are permitted in a list of addresses,
    the default in this case is the current line '.'; thus ',100' is
    equivalent to '*.*,100'. It is an error to give a prefix address to
    a command which expects none.


            Command descriptions

    The following form is a prototype for all /ex/ commands:

        /address/ *command* /! parameters count flags/

    All parts are optional; the degenerate case is the empty command
    which prints the next line in the file. For sanity with use from
    within /visual/ mode, /ex/ ignores a '':'' preceding any command.

    In the following command descriptions, the default addresses are
    shown in parentheses, which are /not,/ however, part of the command.
    *abbreviate* /word rhs/     abbr: *ab*
     	Add the named abbreviation to the current list. When in input mode
    in visual, if /word/ is typed as a complete word, it will be changed
    to /rhs ./
    ( *.* ) *append*    abbr: *a*
    /text/
    *.*
     	Reads the input text and places it after the specified line. After
    the command, '*.*' addresses the last line input or the specified
    line if no lines were input. If address '0' is given, text is placed
    at the beginning of the buffer.
    *a!*
    /text/
    *.*
     	The variant flag to /append/ toggles the setting for the
    /autoindent/ option during the input of /text./
    *args* 	The members of the argument list are printed, with the
    current argument delimited by '[' and ']'.
    *cd* /directory/
     	The /cd/ command is a synonym for /chdir./
    ( *.* , *.* ) *change* /count/  abbr: *c*
    /text/
    *.*
     	Replaces the specified lines with the input /text/. The current
    line becomes the last line input; if no lines were input it is left
    as for a /delete/.
    *c!*
    /text/
    *.*
     	The variant toggles /autoindent/ during the /change./
    *chdir* /directory/
     	The specified /directory/ becomes the current directory. If no
    directory is specified, the current value of the /home/ option is
    used as the target directory. After a /chdir/ the current file is
    not considered to have been edited so that write restrictions on
    pre-existing files apply.
    ( *.* , *.* )*copy* /addr/ /flags/        abbr: *co*
     	A /copy/ of the specified lines is placed after /addr,/ which may
    be '0'. The current line '*.*' addresses the last line of the copy.
    The command /t/ is a synonym for /copy./
    ( *.* , *.* )*delete* /buffer/ /count/ /flags/      abbr: *d*
     	Removes the specified lines from the buffer. The line after the
    last line deleted becomes the current line; if the lines deleted
    were originally at the end, the new last line becomes the current
    line. If a named /buffer/ is specified by giving a letter, then the
    specified lines are saved in that buffer, or appended to it if an
    upper case letter is used.
    *edit* /file/       abbr: *e*
    *ex* /file/
     	Used to begin an editing session on a new file. The editor first
    checks to see if the buffer has been modified since the last /write/
    command was issued. If it has been, a warning is issued and the
    command is aborted. The command otherwise deletes the entire
    contents of the editor buffer, makes the named file the current file
    and prints the new filename. After insuring that this file is
    sensible (i.e., that it is not a binary file such as a directory, a
    block or character special file other than //dev/tty,/ a terminal,
    or a binary or executable file), the editor reads the file into its
    buffer.

    If the read of the file completes without error, the number of lines
    and characters read is typed. Any null characters in the file are
    discarded. If none of these errors occurred, the file is considered
    /edited./ If the last line of the input file is missing the trailing
    newline character, it will be supplied and a complaint will be
    issued. This command leaves the current line '*.*' at the last line
    read. If executed from within /open/ or /visual,/ the current line
    is initially the first line of the file.

    *e!* /file/ 	The variant form suppresses the complaint about
    modifications having been made and not written from the editor
    buffer, thus discarding all changes which have been made before
    editing the new file.
    *e* *+*/n/ /file/
     	Causes the editor to begin at line /n/ rather than at the last
    line; /n/ may also be an editor command containing no spaces, e.g.:
    ''+/pat''.
    *file*    abbr: *f*
     	Prints the current file name, whether it has been '[Modified]'
    since the last /write/ command, whether it is /read only ,/ the
    current line, the number of lines in the buffer, and the percentage
    of the way through the buffer of the current line. In the rare case
    that the current file is '[Not edited]' this is noted also; in this
    case one has to use the form *w!* to write to the file, since the
    editor is not sure that a *write* will not destroy a file unrelated
    to the current contents of the buffer.
    *file* /file/
     	The current file name is changed to /file/ which is considered
    '[Not edited]'.
    ( 1 , $ ) *global* //pat// /cmds/     abbr: *g*
     	First marks each line among those specified which matches the
    given regular expression. Then the given command list is executed
    with '*.*' initially set to each marked line.
    	The command list consists of the remaining commands on the current
    input line and may continue to multiple lines by ending all but the
    last such line with a '\'. If /cmds/ (and possibly the trailing */*
    delimiter) is omitted, each line matching /pat/ is printed.
    /Append,/ /insert,/ and /change/ commands and associated input are
    permitted; the '*.*' terminating input may be omitted if it would be
    on the last line of the command list. /Open/ and /visual/ commands
    are permitted in the command list and take input from the terminal.
    	The /global/ command itself may not appear in /cmds./ The /undo/
    command is also not permitted there, as /undo/ instead can be used
    to reverse the entire /global/ command. The options /autoprint/ and
    /autoindent/ are inhibited during a /global,/ (and possibly the
    trailing */* delimiter) and the value of the /report/ option is
    temporarily infinite, in deference to a /report/ for the entire
    global. Finally, the context mark '''' is set to the value of '.'
    before the global command begins and is not changed during a global
    command, except perhaps by an /open/ or /visual/ within the /global./
    *g!* */*/pat/*/* /cmds/   abbr: *v*
     	The variant form of /global/ runs /cmds/ at each line not matching
    /pat/.
    ( *.* )*insert*     abbr: *i*
    /text/
    *.*
     	Places the given text before the specified line. The current line
    is left at the last line input; if there were none input it is left
    at the line before the addressed line. This command differs from
    /append/ only in the placement of text.
    *i!*
    /text/
    *.*
     	The variant toggles /autoindent/ during the /insert./
    ( *.* , *.*+1 ) *join* /count/ /flags/    abbr: *j*
     	Places the text from a specified range of lines together on one
    line. White space is adjusted at each junction to provide at least
    one blank character, two if there was a '*.*' at the end of the
    line, or none if the first following character is a ')'. If there is
    already white space at the end of the line, then the white space at
    the start of the next line will be discarded.
    *j!* 	The variant causes a simpler /join/ with no white space
    processing; the characters in the lines are simply concatenated.
    ( *.* ) *k* /x/ 	The /k/ command is a synonym for /mark./ It does
    not require a blank or tab before the following letter.
    ( *.* , *.* ) *list* /count/ /flags/
     	Prints the specified lines in a more unambiguous way: tabs are
    printed as '^I' and the end of each line is marked with a trailing
    '$'. The current line is left at the last line printed.
    *map*[*!*] /lhs/ /rhs/
     	The /map/ command is used to define macros for use in /visual/
    command mode. /Lhs/ should be a single character, or the sequence
    ''#n'', for n a digit, referring to function key /n/. When this
    character or function key is typed in /visual/ mode, it will be as
    though the corresponding /rhs/ had been typed. On terminals without
    function keys, the user can type ''#n''. If the '*!*' character
    follows the command name, the mapping is interpreted in input mode.
    See section 6.9 of the ''Introduction to Display Editing with Vi''
    for more details.
    ( *.* ) *mark* /x/
     	Gives the specified line mark /x,/ a single lower case letter. The
    /x/ must be preceded by a blank or a tab. The addressing form ''x'
    then addresses this line. The current line is not affected by this
    command.
    ( *.* , *.* ) *move* /addr/     abbr: *m*
     	The /move/ command repositions the specified lines to be after
    /addr ./ The first of the moved lines becomes the current line.
    *next*    abbr: *n*
     	The next file from the command line argument list is edited.
    *n!* 	The variant suppresses warnings about the modifications to the
    buffer not having been written out, discarding (irretrievably) any
    changes which may have been made.
    *n* /filelist/
    *n* *+*/command/ /filelist/
     	The specified /filelist/ is expanded and the resulting list
    replaces the current argument list; the first file in the new list
    is then edited. If /command/ is given (it must contain no spaces),
    then it is executed after editing the first such file.
    ( *.* , *.* ) *number* /count/ /flags/    abbr: *#* or *nu*
     	Prints each specified line preceded by its buffer line number. The
    current line is left at the last line printed.
    ( *.* ) *open* /flags/        abbr: *o*
    ( *.* ) *open* //pat// /flags/
     	Enters intraline editing /open/ mode at each addressed line. If
    /pat/ is given, then the cursor will be placed initially at the
    beginning of the string matched by the pattern. To exit this mode
    use Q. See /An Introduction to Display Editing with Vi/ for more
    details.
    *preserve*
     	The current editor buffer is saved as though the system had just
    crashed. This command is for use only in emergencies when a /write/
    command has resulted in an error.
    ( *.* , *.* )*print* /count/    abbr: *p* or *P*
     	Prints the specified lines with non-printing characters printed as
    control characters '^/x/'; delete (octal 177) is represented as
    '^?'. The current line is left at the last line printed.
    ( *.* )*put* /buffer/ abbr: *pu*
     	Puts back previously /deleted/ or /yanked/ lines. Normally used
    with /delete/ to effect movement of lines, or with /yank/ to effect
    duplication of lines. If no /buffer/ is specified, then the last
    /deleted/ or /yanked/ text is restored. But no modifying commands
    may intervene between the /delete/ or /yank/ and the /put,/ nor may
    lines be moved between files without using a named buffer. By using
    a named buffer, text may be restored that was saved there at any
    previous time.
    *quit*    abbr: *q*
     	Causes /ex/ to terminate. No automatic write of the editor buffer
    to a file is performed. However, /ex/ issues a warning message if
    the file has changed since the last /write/ command was issued, and
    does not /quit./ /Ex/ will also issue a diagnostic if there are more
    files in the argument list. Normally, the user will wish to save his
    changes, and he should give a /write/ command; if he wishes to
    discard them, he should the *q!* command variant.
    *q!* 	Quits from the editor, discarding changes to the buffer
    without complaint.
    ( *.* ) *read* /file/ abbr: *r*
     	Places a copy of the text of the given file in the editing buffer
    after the specified line. If no /file/ is given the current file
    name is used. The current file name is not changed unless there is
    none in which case /file/ becomes the current name. The sensibility
    restrictions for the /edit/ command apply here also. If the file
    buffer is empty and there is no current name then /ex/ treats this
    as an /edit/ command.
    	Address '0' is legal for this command and causes the file to be
    read at the beginning of the buffer. Statistics are given as for the
    /edit/ command when the /read/ successfully terminates. After a
    /read/ the current line is the last line read. Within /open/ and
    /visual/ the current line is set to the first line read rather than
    the last.
    ( *.* ) *read* *!*/command/
     	Reads the output of the command /command/ into the buffer after
    the specified line. This is not a variant form of the command,
    rather a read specifying a /command/ rather than a /filename;/ a
    blank or tab before the *!* is mandatory.
    *recover */file/
     	Recovers /file/ from the system save area. Used after a accidental
    hangup of the phone or a system crash or /preserve/ command. Except
    when /preserve/ is used, the user will be notified by mail when a
    file is saved.
    *rewind*  abbr: *rew*
     	The argument list is rewound, and the first file in the list is
    edited.
    *rew!* 	Rewinds the argument list discarding any changes made to the
    current buffer.
    *set* /parameter/
     	With no arguments, prints those options whose values have been
    changed from their defaults; with parameter /all/ it prints all of
    the option values.
    	Giving an option name followed by a '?' causes the current value of
    that option to be printed. The '?' is unnecessary unless the option
    is Boolean valued. Boolean options are given values either by the
    form 'set /option/' to turn them on or 'set no/option/' to turn them
    off; string and numeric options are assigned via the form 'set
    /option/=value'.
    	More than one parameter may be given to /set ;/ they are
    interpreted left-to-right.
    	A list of options can be found below.
    *shell*   abbr: *sh*
     	A new shell is created. When it terminates, editing resumes.
    *source* /file/     abbr: *so*
     	Reads and executes commands from the specified file. /Source/
    commands may be nested.
    ( *.* , *.* ) *substitute* //pat///repl// /options/ /count/ /flags/
     	abbr: *s*
    On each specified line, the first instance of pattern /pat/ is
    replaced by replacement pattern /repl./ If the /global/ indicator
    option character 'g' appears, then all instances are substituted; if
    the /confirm/ indication character 'c' appears, then before each
    substitution the line to be substituted is typed with the string to
    be substituted marked with '^' characters. By typing an 'y' one can
    cause the substitution to be performed, any other input causes no
    change to take place. After a /substitute/ the current line is the
    last line substituted.

    Lines may be split by substituting new-line characters into them.
    The newline in /repl/ must be escaped by preceding it with a '\'.
    Other metacharacters available in /pat/ and /repl/ are described below.

    *stop* 	Suspends the editor, returning control to the top level
    shell. If /autowrite/ is set and there are unsaved changes, a write
    is done first unless the form *stop !* is used. This commands is
    only available where supported by the teletype driver, shell and
    operating system.
    ( *.* , *.* ) *substitute* /options/ /count/ /flags/        abbr: *s*
     	If /pat/ and /repl/ are omitted, then the last substitution is
    repeated. This is a synonym for the *&* command.
    ( *.* , *.* ) *t* /addr/ /flags/
     	The /t/ command is a synonym for /copy ./
    *ta* /tag/ 	The focus of editing switches to the location of /tag,/
    switching to a different line in the current file where it is
    defined, or if necessary to another file.
    	The tags file is normally created by a program such as /ctags,/ and
    consists of a number of lines with three fields separated by blanks
    or tabs. The first field gives the name of the tag, the second the
    name of the file where the tag resides, and the third gives an
    addressing form which can be used by the editor to find the tag;
    this field is usually a contextual scan using '//pat//' to be immune
    to minor changes in the file. Such scans are always performed as if
    /nomagic/ was set.
    	The tag names in the tags file must be sorted alphabetically.
    *unabbreviate* /word/       abbr: *una*
     	Delete /word/ from the list of abbreviations.
    *undo*    abbr: *u*
     	Reverses the changes made in the buffer by the last buffer editing
    command. Note that /global/ commands are considered a single command
    for the purpose of /undo/ (as are /open/ and /visual.)/ Also, the
    commands /write/ and /edit/ which interact with the file system
    cannot be undone. /Undo/ is its own inverse.
    	/Undo/ always marks the previous value of the current line '*.*' as
    ''''. After an /undo/ the current line is the first line restored or
    the line before the first line deleted if no lines were restored.
    For commands with more global effect such as /global/ and /visual/
    the current line regains it's pre-command value after an /undo./
    *unmap*[*!*] /lhs/
     	The macro expansion associated by /map/ for /lhs/ is removed.
    ( 1 , $ ) *v* //pat// /cmds/
     	A synonym for the /global/ command variant *g!*, running the
    specified /cmds/ on each line which does not match /pat/.
    *version* abbr: *ve*
     	Prints the current version number of the editor as well as the
    date the editor was last changed.
    ( *.* ) *visual* /type/ /count/ /flags/   abbr: *vi*
     	Enters visual mode at the specified line. /Type/ is optional and
    may be '-' , '^' or '*.*' as in the /z/ command to specify the
    placement of the specified line on the screen. By default, if /type/
    is omitted, the specified line is placed as the first on the screen.
    A /count/ specifies an initial window size; the default is the value
    of the option /window./ See the document /An Introduction to Display
    Editing with Vi/ for more details. To exit this mode, type Q.
    *visual* file
    *visual* +/n/ file
     	From visual mode, this command is the same as edit.
    ( 1 , $ ) *write* /file/    abbr: *w*
     	Writes changes made back to /file/, printing the number of lines
    and characters written. Normally /file/ is omitted and the text goes
    back where it came from. If a /file/ is specified, then text will be
    written to that file. If the file does not exist it is created. The
    current file name is changed only if there is no current file name;
    the current line is never changed.
    	If an error occurs while writing the current and /edited/ file, the
    editor considers that there has been ''No write since last change''
    even if the buffer had not previously been modified.
    ( 1 , $ ) *write>>* /file/  abbr: *w>>*
     	Writes the buffer contents at the end of an existing file.
    	
    *w!* /name/ 	Overrides the checking of the normal /write/ command,
    and will write to any file which the system permits.
    ( 1 , $ ) *w* *!*/command/
     	Writes the specified lines into /command./ Note the difference
    between *w!* which overrides checks and *w  !* which writes to a
    command.
    *wq* /name/
     	Like a /write/ and then a /quit/ command.
    *wq!* /name/
     	The variant overrides checking on the sensibility of the /write/
    command, as *w!* does.
    *xit* /name/
     	If any changes have been made and not written to any file, writes
    the buffer out. Then, in any case, quits.
    ( *.* , *.* )*yank* /buffer/ /count/      abbr: *ya*
     	Places the specified lines in the named /buffer,/ for later
    retrieval via /put./ If no buffer name is specified, the lines go to
    a more volatile place; see the /put/ command description.
    ( *.+1* ) *z* /count/
     	Print the next /count/ lines, default /window/.
    ( *.* ) *z* /type/ /count/
     	Prints a window of text with the specified line at the top. If
    /type/ is '-' the line is placed at the bottom; a '*.*' causes the
    line to be placed in the center. A count gives the number of lines
    to be displayed rather than double the number specified by the
    /scroll/ option. On a CRT the screen is cleared before display
    begins unless a count which is less than the screen size is given.
    The current line is left at the last line printed. Forms 'z=' and
    'z^' also exist; 'z=' places the current line in the center,
    surrounds it with lines of '-' characters and leaves the current
    line at this line. The form 'z^' prints the window before 'z-'
    would. The characters '+', '^' and '-' may be repeated for
    cumulative effect.
    *!* /command/
     	The remainder of the line after the '!' character is sent to a
    shell to be executed. Within the text of /command/ the characters
    '%' and '#' are expanded as in filenames and the character '!' is
    replaced with the text of the previous command. Thus, in particular,
    '!!' repeats the last such shell escape. If any such expansion is
    performed, the expanded line will be echoed. The current line is
    unchanged by this command.
    	If there has been ''[No write]'' of the buffer contents since the
    last change to the editing buffer, then a diagnostic will be printed
    before the command is executed as a warning. A single '!' is printed
    when the command completes.
    ( /addr/ , /addr/ ) *!* /command/
     	Takes the specified address range and supplies it as standard
    input to /command;/ the resulting output then replaces the input lines.
    ( $ ) *=* 	Prints the line number of the addressed line. The current
    line is unchanged.
    ( *.* , *.* ) *>* /count/ /flags/
    ( *.* , *.* ) *<* /count/ /flags/
     	Perform intelligent shifting on the specified lines; *<* shifts
    left and *>* shift right. The quantity of shift is determined by the
    /shiftwidth/ option and the repetition of the specification
    character. Only white space (blanks and tabs) is shifted; no
    non-white characters are discarded in a left-shift. The current line
    becomes the last line which changed due to the shifting.
    *^D* 	An end-of-file from a terminal input scrolls through the file.
    The /scroll/ option specifies the size of the scroll, normally a
    half screen of text.
    ( *.*+1 , *.*+1 )
    ( *.*+1 , *.*+1 ) |
     	An address alone causes the addressed lines to be printed. A blank
    line prints the next line in the file.
    ( *.* , *.* ) *&* /options/ /count/ /flags/
     	Repeats the previous /substitute/ command.
    ( *.* , *.* ) *~* /options/ /count/ /flags/
     	Replaces the previous regular expression with the previous
    replacement pattern from a substitution.


            Regular expressions

    A regular expression specifies a set of strings of characters. A
    member of this set of strings is said to be /matched/ by the regular
    expression. /Ex/ remembers two previous regular expressions: the
    previous regular expression used in a /substitute/ command and the
    previous regular expression used elsewhere (referred to as the
    previous /scanning/ regular expression.) The previous regular
    expression can always be referred to by a null /re/, e.g. '//' or '??'.

    The following basic constructs are used to construct /magic/ mode
    regular expressions.
    /char/ 	An ordinary character matches itself. The characters '*^*'
    at the beginning of a line, '*$*' at the end of line, '***' as any
    character other than the first, '*.*', '*\*', '*[*', and '*~*' are
    not ordinary characters and must be escaped (preceded) by '*\*' to
    be treated as such.
    *^* 	At the beginning of a pattern forces the match to succeed only
    at the beginning of a line.
    *$* 	At the end of a regular expression forces the match to succeed
    only at the end of the line.
    *.* 	Matches any single character except the new-line character.
    *\<* 	Forces the match to occur only at the beginning of a
    ''variable'' or ''word''; that is, either at the beginning of a
    line, or just before a letter, digit, or underline and after a
    character not one of these.
    *\>* 	Similar to '\<', but matching the end of a ''variable'' or
    ''word'', i.e. either the end of the line or before character which
    is neither a letter, nor a digit, nor the underline character.
    *[*/string/*]* 	Matches any (single) character in the class defined
    by /string./ Most characters in /string/ define themselves.
      A pair of characters separated by '*-*' in /string/ defines the
    set of characters collating between the specified lower and upper
    bounds, thus '[a-z]' as a regular expression matches any (single)
    ASCII lower-case letter.
      If the sequence '*[:*/class/*:]*' appears in /string/, where class
    is one of '*alnum*', '*alpha*', '*blank*', '*cntrl*', '*digit*',
    '*graph*', '*lower*', '*print*', '*punct*', '*space*', '*upper*',
    '*xdigit*', or a locale-specific character class, all characters
    that belong to the given class are matched. Thus '[[:lower:]]'
    matches any lower-case letter, possibly including characters beyond
    the scope of ASCII.
      If the first character of /string/ is an '*^*' then the construct
    matches those characters which it otherwise would not; thus '[^a-z]'
    matches anything but an ASCII lower-case letter (and of course a
    newline).
      Backslash '\' is interpreted as an escape character. To place a
    '\' character in /string/, write it twice: '\\'; to place any of the
    characters '^', '[', or '-' in /string/, you escape them with a
    preceding '\'.
      Characters also lose their special meaning by position: '^' is an
    ordinary character unless immediately following the initial '[', ']'
    is an ordinary character if immediately following the initial '['
    (or '^', if present), and '-' is an ordinary character if placed
    immediately behind '[' or '^', or before ']'.

    The concatenation of two regular expressions matches the leftmost
    and then longest string which can be divided with the first piece
    matching the first regular expression and the second piece matching
    the second.

    A regular expression may be enclosed between the sequences '*\(*'
    and '*\)*', which matches whatever the enclosed expression matches.

    Any of the (single character matching) regular expressions mentioned
    above or a regular expression surrounded by '\(' and '\)' may be
    followed by the character '***' to form a regular expression which
    matches any number of adjacent occurrences (including 0) of
    characters matched by the regular expression it follows.

    A single character regular expression or a regular expression
    surrounded by '\(' and '\)' followed by '*\{*/m/*,*/n/*\}*' matches
    a sequence of /m/ through /n/ occurences, inclusive, of the single
    character expression. The values of /m/ and /n/ must be non-negative
    and smaller than 255. The form '*\{*/m/*\}*' matches exactly /m/
    occurences, '*\{*/m/*,\}*' matches at least /m/ occurences.

    The character '*~*' may be used in a regular expression, and matches
    the text which defined the replacement part of the last /substitute/
    command.

    The sequence '*\*/n/' matches the text that was matched by the
    /n/-th regular subexpression enclosed between '\(' and '\)' earlier
    in the expression.


            Substitute replacement patterns

    The basic metacharacters for the replacement pattern are '*&*',
    '*~*', and '*#*'; the first two of them are given as '*\&*' and
    '*\~*' when /nomagic/ is set. Each instance of '*&*' is replaced by
    the characters which the regular expression matched. The
    metacharacter '*~*' stands, in the replacement pattern, for the
    defining text of the previous replacement pattern. If the entire
    replacement pattern is '*#*', the defining text of the previous
    replacement pattern is used.

    Other metasequences possible in the replacement pattern are always
    introduced by the escaping character '*\*'. The sequence '*\*/n/' is
    replaced by the text matched by the /n/-th regular subexpression
    enclosed between '\(' and '\)'. When nested, parenthesized
    subexpressions are present, /n/ is determined by counting
    occurrences of '\(' starting from the left. The sequences '*\u*' and
    '*\l*' cause the immediately following character in the replacement
    to be converted to upper- or lower-case respectively if this
    character is a letter. The sequences '*\U*' and '*\L*' turn such
    conversion on, either until '*\E*' or '*\e*' is encountered, or
    until the end of the replacement pattern.


            Option descriptions

    *autoindent*, *ai*  default: noai
     	Can be used to ease the preparation of structured program text. At
    the beginning of each /append ,/ /change/ or /insert/ command or
    when a new line is /opened/ or created by an /append ,/ /change ,/
    /insert ,/ or /substitute/ operation within /open/ or /visual/ mode,
    /ex/ looks at the line being appended after, the first line changed
    or the line inserted before and calculates the amount of white space
    at the start of the line. It then aligns the cursor at the level of
    indentation so determined.
    	If the user then types lines of text in, they will continue to be
    justified at the displayed indenting level. If more white space is
    typed at the beginning of a line, the following line will start
    aligned with the first non-white character of the previous line. To
    back the cursor up to the preceding tab stop one can hit *^D*. The
    tab stops going backwards are defined at multiples of the
    /shiftwidth/ option. The user /cannot/ backspace over the indent,
    except by sending an end-of-file with a *^D*.
    	Specially processed in this mode is a line with no characters added
    to it, which turns into a completely blank line (the white space
    provided for the /autoindent/ is discarded.) Also specially
    processed in this mode are lines beginning with an '^' and
    immediately followed by a *^D*. This causes the input to be
    repositioned at the beginning of the line, but retaining the
    previous indent for the next line. Similarly, a '0' followed by a
    *^D* repositions at the beginning but without retaining the previous
    indent.
    	/Autoindent/ doesn't happen in /global/ commands or when the input
    is not a terminal.
    *autoprint*, *ap*   default: ap
     	Causes the current line to be printed after each /delete ,/ /copy
    ,/ /join ,/ /move ,/ /substitute ,/ /t ,/ /undo/ or shift command.
    This has the same effect as supplying a trailing 'p' to each such
    command. /Autoprint/ is suppressed in globals, and only applies to
    the last of many commands on a line.
    *autowrite*, *aw*   default: noaw
     	Causes the contents of the buffer to be written to the current
    file if the user has modified it and gives a /next,/ /rewind,/
    /stop,/ /tag,/ or /!/ command, or a *^^* (switch files) or *^]* (tag
    goto) command in /visual./ Note, that the /edit/ and /ex/ commands
    do *not* autowrite. In each case, there is an equivalent way of
    switching when autowrite is set to avoid the /autowrite/ (/edit/ for
    /next ,/ /rewind!/ for .I rewind , /stop!/ for /stop ,/ /tag!/ for
    /tag ,/ /shell/ for /! ,/ and *:e #* and a *:ta!* command from
    within /visual)./
    *beautify*, *bf*    default: nobeautify
     	Causes all control characters except tab, newline and form-feed to
    be discarded from the input. A complaint is registered the first
    time a backspace character is discarded. /Beautify/ does not apply
    to command input.
    *directory*, *dir*  default: dir=/tmp
     	Specifies the directory in which /ex/ places its buffer file. If
    this directory in not writable, then the editor will exit abruptly
    when it fails to be able to create its buffer there.
    *edcompatible*    default: noedcompatible
     	Causes the presence of absence of *g* and *c* suffixes on
    substitute commands to be remembered, and to be toggled by repeating
    the suffices. The suffix *r* makes the substitution be as in the /~/
    command, instead of like /&./
    *errorbells*, *eb*  default: noeb
     	Error messages are preceded by a bell. Bell ringing in /open/ and
    /visual/ on errors is not suppressed by setting /noeb./ If possible
    the editor always places the error message in a standout mode of the
    terminal (such as inverse video) instead of ringing the bell.
    *exrc*                    default: noexrc
     	If set, the current directory is searched for a /.exrc/ file on
    startup. If this file is found, its content is treated as /ex/
    commands and executed immediately after the contents of
    /$HOME/.exrc/ on startup.
    *flash*, *fl*       default: flash
     	If the terminal provides the ''visual bell'' capability, ex will
    use it instead of the audible bell if /flash/ is set.
    *hardtabs*, *ht*    default: ht=8
     	Gives the boundaries on which terminal hardware tabs are set (or
    on which the system expands tabs).
    *ignorecase*, *ic*  default: noic
     	All upper case characters in the text are mapped to lower case in
    regular expression matching. In addition, all upper case characters
    in regular expressions are mapped to lower case except in character
    class specifications.
    *lisp*    default: nolisp
     	/Autoindent/ indents appropriately for /lisp/ code, and the *( ) {
    } [[* and *]]* commands in /open/ and /visual/ are modified to have
    meaning for /lisp/.
    *list*    default: nolist
     	All printed lines will be displayed (more) unambiguously, showing
    tabs and end-of-lines as in the /list/ command.
    *magic*   default: magic for /ex/ and /vi/, /Nomagic/ for /edit/.
     	If /nomagic/ is set, the number of regular expression
    metacharacters is greatly reduced, with only '^' and '$' having
    special effects. In addition the metacharacters '~' and '&' of the
    replacement pattern are treated as normal characters. All the normal
    metacharacters may be made /magic/ when /nomagic/ is set by
    preceding them with a '\'.
    *mesg*    default: mesg
     	Causes write permission to be turned off to the terminal while the
    user is in visual mode, if /nomesg/ is set.
    *modelines, ml*   default: nomodelines
     	If /modelines/ is set, then the first 5 lines and the last five
    lines of the file will be checked for ex command lines and the
    comands issued. To be recognized as a command line, the line must
    have the string *ex:* or *vi:* in it. This string may be anywhere in
    the line and anything after the /:/ is interpeted as editor
    commands. This option defaults to off because of unexpected behavior
    when editting files such as //etc/passwd./
    *number, nu*      default: nonumber
     	Causes all output lines to be printed with their line numbers. In
    addition each input line will be prompted for by supplying the line
    number it will have.
    *open*    default: open
     	If /noopen/, the commands /open/ and /visual/ are not permitted.
    *optimize, opt*   default: optimize
     	Throughput of text is expedited by setting the terminal to not do
    automatic carriage returns when printing more than one (logical)
    line of output, greatly speeding output on terminals without
    addressable cursors when text with leading white space is printed.
    *paragraphs, para*        default: para=IPLPPPQPP LIbp
     	Specifies the paragraphs for the *{* and *}* operations in /open/
    and /visual./ The pairs of characters in the option's value are the
    names of the macros which start paragraphs.
    *prompt*  default: prompt
     	Command mode input is prompted for with a ':'.
    *redraw*  default: noredraw
     	The editor simulates (using great amounts of output), an
    intelligent terminal on a dumb terminal (e.g. during insertions in
    /visual/ the characters to the right of the cursor position are
    refreshed as each input character is typed.) Useful only at very
    high speed.
    *remap*   default: remap
     	If on, macros are repeatedly tried until they are unchanged. For
    example, if *o* is mapped to *O ,* and *O* is mapped to *I ,* then
    if /remap/ is set, *o* will map to *I ,* but if /noremap/ is set, it
    will map to *O .*
    *report*  default: report=5, 2 for /edit/.
     	Specifies a threshold for feedback from commands. Any command
    which modifies more than the specified number of lines will provide
    feedback as to the scope of its changes. For commands such as
    /global ,/ /open ,/ /undo ,/ and /visual/ which have potentially
    more far reaching scope, the net change in the number of lines in
    the buffer is presented at the end of the command, subject to this
    same threshold. Thus notification is suppressed during a /global/
    command on the individual commands performed.
    *scroll*  default: scroll=½ window
     	Determines the number of logical lines scrolled when an
    end-of-file is received from a terminal input in command mode, and
    the number of lines printed by a command mode /z/ command (double
    the value of /scroll )./
    *sections*        default: sections=SHNHH HU
     	Specifies the section macros for the *[[* and *]]* operations in
    /open/ and /visual./ The pairs of characters in the options's value
    are the names of the macros which start paragraphs.
    *shell*, *sh*       default: sh=/bin/sh
     	Gives the path name of the shell forked for the shell escape
    command '!', and by the /shell/ command. The default is taken from
    SHELL in the environment, if present.
    *shiftwidth*, *sw*  default: sw=8
     	Gives the width a software tab stop, used in reverse tabbing with
    *^D* when using /autoindent/ to append text, and by the shift commands.
    *showmatch, sm*   default: nosm
     	In /open/ and /visual/ mode, when a *)* or *}* is typed, move the
    cursor to the matching *(* or *{* for one second if this matching
    character is on the screen. Extremely useful with /lisp./
    *showmode, smd*   default: nosmd
     	In /visual/ mode, show a description of the current editing mode
    in the window's lower right corner.
    *slowopen, slow*  terminal dependent
     	Affects the display algorithm used in /visual/ mode, holding off
    display updating during input of new text to improve throughput when
    the terminal in use is both slow and unintelligent. See /An
    Introduction to Display Editing with Vi/ for more details.
    *tabstop, ts*     default: ts=8
     	The editor expands tabs in the input file to be on /tabstop/
    boundaries for the purposes of display.
    *taglength, tl*   default: tl=0
     	Tags are not significant beyond this many characters. A value of
    zero (the default) means that all characters are significant.
    *tags*    default: tags=tags /usr/lib/tags
     	A path of files to be used as tag files for the /tag/ command. A
    requested tag is searched for in the specified files, sequentially.
    By default, files called *tags* are searched for in the current
    directory and in /usr/lib (a master file for the entire system).
    *term*    from environment TERM
     	The terminal type of the output device.
    *terse*   default: noterse
     	Shorter error diagnostics are produced for the experienced user.
    *warn*    default: warn
     	Warn if there has been '[No write since last change]' before a '!'
    command escape.
    *window*  default: window=speed dependent
     	The number of lines in a text window in the /visual/ command. The
    default is 8 at slow speeds (600 baud or less), 16 at medium speed
    (1200 baud), and the full screen (minus one line) at higher speeds.
    *w300, w1200, w9600*
     	These are not true options but set *window* only if the speed is
    slow (300), medium (1200), or high (9600), respectively. They are
    suitable for an EXINIT and make it easy to change the 8/16/full
    screen rule.
    *wrapscan*, *ws*    default: ws
     	Searches using the regular expressions in addressing will wrap
    around past the end of the file.
    *wrapmargin*, *wm*  default: wm=0
     	Defines a margin for automatic wrapover of text during input in
    /open/ and /visual/ modes. See /An Introduction to Text Editing with
    Vi/ for details.
    *writeany*, *wa*    default: nowa
    	Inhibit the checks normally made before /write/ commands, allowing
    a write to any file which the system protection mechanism will allow.


      ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

    The following environment variables affect the behaviour of ex:
    *COLUMNS*
     	Overrides the system-supplied number of terminal columns.
    *EXINIT* 	Contains commands to execute at editor startup. If this
    variable is present, the /.exrc/ file in the user's home directory
    is ignored.
    *HOME* 	Used to locate the editor startup file.
    *LANG*, *LC_ALL*
     	See /locale/(7).
    *LC_CTYPE*
     	Determines the mapping of bytes to characters, types of
    characters, case conversion and composition of character classes in
    regular expressions.
    *LC_MESSAGES*
     	Sets the language used for diagnostic and informal messages.
    *LINES* 	Overrides the system-supplied number of terminal lines.
    *NLSPATH*
     	See /catopen/(3).
    *SHELL* 	The program file used to execute external commands.
    *TERM* 	Determines the terminal type.

      DOCUMENTATION

    The document /Edit: A tutorial/ (USD:14) provides a comprehensive
    introduction to /edit/ assuming no previous knowledge of computers
    or the UNIX system.

    The /Ex Reference Manual - Version 3.7/ (USD:16) is a comprehensive
    and complete manual for the command mode features of /ex./ The
    /USAGE/ section of this page is taken from the manual. For an
    introduction to more advanced forms of editing using the command
    mode of /ex/ see the editing documents written by Brian Kernighan
    for the editor /ed;/ the material in the introductory and advanced
    documents works also with /ex./

    /An Introduction to Display Editing with Vi/ (USD:15) introduces the
    display editor /vi/ and provides reference material on /vi./ (This
    reference now forms the /vi/(1) manual page). In addition, the /Vi
    Quick Reference/ card summarizes the commands of /vi/ in a useful,
    functional way, and is useful with the /Introduction./

      AUTHOR

    Originally written by William Joy.

    Mark Horton has maintained the editor since version 2.7, adding
    macros, support for many unusual terminals, and other features such
    as word abbreviation mode.

    This version incorporates changes by Gunnar Ritter.


      NOTES

    /Undo/ never clears the buffer modified condition.

    The /z/ command prints a number of logical rather than physical
    lines. More than a screen full of output may result if long lines
    are present.

    File input/output errors don't print a name if the command line
    *'-'* option is used.

    The editor does not warn if text is placed in named buffers and not
    used before exiting the editor.

    Null (00) characters are converted to 0200 characters when reading
    input files, and cannot appear in resultant files.

    LC_COLLATE locales are ignored; collating symbols '[.c.]' and
    equivalence classes '[=c=]' in bracket expressions are recognized
    but useless since 'c' is restricted to a single character and is the
    only character matched; range expressions '[a-m]' are always
    evaluated in byte order.

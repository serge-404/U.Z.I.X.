# MD5 program used to create the checksums in the top-level file `checksums'.
# This program is copyright RSA Data Security, Inc.
#
# This actual version is derived from the libraries and applications in
# FreeBSD 2.2.6, but is given here in `standalone' format. It is known
# to compile cleanly on FreeBSD 2.2.6 and Solaris 2.4. Fixes for other
# platforms most welcome! Email them to wkt@cs.adfa.oz.au.
#
# The top-level checksums is generated by doing:
#
#    % cd top-level
#    % find * -type f -print | xargs md5 > checksums
#
# You can do this to generate your own file, and then use diff or cmp to
# verify that they are the same. You might need to sort your checksums and
# the top-level checksums, just in case find(1) prints out the file list
# in a different order.

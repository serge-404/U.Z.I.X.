       md5  -  calculate  a message-digest fingerprint (checksum)
       for a file

       mmdd55 takes as input a message of arbitrary length and  pro-
       duces  as  output  a  128-bit  "fingerprint"  or  "message
       digest" of the input.  It is conjectured that it is compu-
       tationally  infeasible  to produce two messages having the
       same message digest, or to produce any  message	having	a
       given  prespecified  target message digest.  The MD5 algo-
       rithm is  intended  for	digital  signature  applications,
       where a large file must be "compressed" in a secure manner
       before being encrypted with a private (secret) key under a
       public-key cryptosystem such as _R_S_A_.

       The following four options may be used in any combination,
       except that ffiilleennaammee((ss)) must be the last  objects  on  the
       command line.

       --ssssttrriinngg prints a checksum of the given "string".

       --pp  echos  stdin to stdout and appends the MD5 sum to std-
       out.

       --tt runs a built-in time trial.

       --xx runs a built-in test script.

       ffiilleennaammee((ss)) prints a checksum(s) for each of the files.

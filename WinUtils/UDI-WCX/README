UZIX utilities

   This directory contains several utilities to manage UZIX filesystems from
a different host operating system (despite they are customized for MS(X)DOS). 
   There are five programs, each contained in the C file of the same name:

   MKFS:       This makes a file system.  It takes four arguments: a drive
	       name, the total number of blocks, the number of inodes and
	       the total of reserved blocks (for kernel image, used by
	       mkboot) [optional].

   FSCK:       This checks file system consistency.  It takes a single
	       argument, the drive name to check.

   MKBOOT:     This makes a UZIX disk bootable. It takes four arguments: a
	       drive name, the primary bootstrap file, the secondary
	       bootstrap file and the kernel image file.

   BD:         This dumps (in hex) a block of a disk. It takes three
	       arguments:  the drive name, the number of the first block
	       to dump and the number of the last block to dump [optional].

   UCP:        This is an interactive program that performs a number of
	       operations.  It can be used to make and delete directories and
	       device files, upload and download files between the host OS and
	       the UZIX filesystem, list directories, and print files.  It
	       takes a single argument, the drive name. It then prompts
	       for commands.  Type 'help' at the prompt for a complete list of
	       commands.
